This can only be done if the new BAR size/flags does not differ from the existing BAR configuration. Add these missing checks. If we allow set_bar() to set e.g. a new BAR size that differs from the existing BAR size, the new address translation range will be smaller than the BAR size already determined by the host, which would mean that a read past the new BAR size would pass the iATU untranslated, which could allow the host to read memory not belonging to the new struct pci_epf_bar.

Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend(), so that the size of the field is also taken into account.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-125""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.4"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.1.129"",""matchCriteriaId"":""654E7F30-F4AB-407B-A548-C9774836B7C8""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.2"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.6.78"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0C58261F-EDFB-4A12-8CCD-F12101482030""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.7"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.14"",""matchCriteriaId"":""033BB7EE-C9A2-45EA-BAC9-87BB9D951BCD""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.13"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.13.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0E92CEE3-1FC3-4AFC-A513-DEDBA7414F00""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0a92feddae0634a0b87c04b19d343f6af97af700"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/22cf4fae6660b6e1a583a41cbf84e3046ca9ccd0"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2495c6598731b6d7f565140f2bd63ef4bc36ce7d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d09d3c9afa2fc422ac3df7c9b8534f350ee19dd"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/407c928305c1a37232a63811c400ef616f85ccbc"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/47470acd719d45c4c8c418c07962f74cc995652b"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7445fa05317534bbd8b373c0eff8319187916030"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c88b3a3fae4d60641c3a45be66269d00eff33cd"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.2}]",,,,,,,

Thus, it can overwrite the RPC request that GSP is currently reading, which causes GSP hang due to corrupted RPC request: [ 549.209389] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 549.214010] WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 6314 at drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/gsp/r535.c:116 r535_gsp_msgq_wait+0xd0/0x190 [nvkm] [ 549.225678] Modules linked in: nvkm(E+) gsp_log(E) snd_seq_dummy(E) snd_hrtimer(E) snd_seq(E) snd_timer(E) snd_seq_device(E) snd(E) soundcore(E) rfkill(E) qrtr(E) vfat(E) fat(E) ipmi_ssif(E) amd_atl(E) intel_rapl_msr(E) intel_rapl_common(E) mlx5_ib(E) amd64_edac(E) edac_mce_amd(E) kvm_amd(E) ib_uverbs(E) kvm(E) ib_core(E) acpi_ipmi(E) ipmi_si(E) mxm_wmi(E) ipmi_devintf(E) rapl(E) i2c_piix4(E) wmi_bmof(E) joydev(E) ptdma(E) acpi_cpufreq(E) k10temp(E) pcspkr(E) ipmi_msghandler(E) xfs(E) libcrc32c(E) ast(E) i2c_algo_bit(E) crct10dif_pclmul(E) drm_shmem_helper(E) nvme_tcp(E) crc32_pclmul(E) ahci(E) drm_kms_helper(E) libahci(E) nvme_fabrics(E) crc32c_intel(E) nvme(E) cdc_ether(E) mlx5_core(E) nvme_core(E) usbnet(E) drm(E) libata(E) ccp(E) ghash_clmulni_intel(E) mii(E) t10_pi(E) mlxfw(E) sp5100_tco(E) psample(E) pci_hyperv_intf(E) wmi(E) dm_multipath(E) sunrpc(E) dm_mirror(E) dm_region_hash(E) dm_log(E) dm_mod(E) be2iscsi(E) bnx2i(E) cnic(E) uio(E) cxgb4i(E) cxgb4(E) tls(E) libcxgbi(E) libcxgb(E) qla4xxx(E) [ 549.225752] iscsi_boot_sysfs(E) iscsi_tcp(E) libiscsi_tcp(E) libiscsi(E) scsi_transport_iscsi(E) fuse(E) [last unloaded: gsp_log(E)] [ 549.326293] CPU: 8 PID: 6314 Comm: insmod Tainted: G E 6.9.0-rc6+ #1 [ 549.334039] Hardware name: ASRockRack 1U1G-MILAN/N/ROMED8-NL, BIOS L3.12E 09/06/2022 [ 549.341781] RIP: 0010:r535_gsp_msgq_wait+0xd0/0x190 [nvkm] [ 549.347343] Code: 08 00 00 89 da c1 e2 0c 48 8d ac 11 00 10 00 00 48 8b 0c 24 48 85 c9 74 1f c1 e0 0c 4c 8d 6d 30 83 e8 30 89 01 e9 68 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 49 c7 c5 92 ff ff ff e9 5a ff ff ff ba ff ff ff ff be c0 0c [ 549.366090] RSP: 0018:ffffacbccaaeb7d0 EFLAGS: 00010246 [ 549.371315] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000012 RCX: 0000000000923e28 [ 549.378451] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000055555554 RDI: ffffacbccaaeb730 [ 549.385590] RBP: 0000000000000001 R08: ffff8bd14d235f70 R09: ffff8bd14d235f70 [ 549.392721] R10: 0000000000000002 R11: ffff8bd14d233864 R12: 0000000000000020 [ 549.399854] R13: ffffacbccaaeb818 R14: 0000000000000020 R15: ffff8bb298c67000 [ 549.406988] FS: 00007f5179244740(0000) GS:ffff8bd14d200000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 [ 549.415076] CS: 0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 [ 549.420829] CR2: 00007fa844000010 CR3: 00000001567dc005 CR4: 0000000000770ef0 [ 549.427963] PKRU: 55555554 [ 549.430672] Call Trace: [ 549.433126] <TASK> [ 549.435233] ? __warn+0x7f/0x130 [ 549.438473] ? r535_gsp_msgq_wait+0xd0/0x190 [nvkm] [ 549.443426] ? report_bug+0x18a/0x1a0 [ 549.447098] ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70 [ 549.450589] ? exc_invalid_op+0x14/0x70 [ 549.454430] ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20 [ 549.458619] ? r535_gsp_msgq_wait+0xd0/0x190 [nvkm] [ 549.463565] r535_gsp_msg_recv+0x46/0x230 [nvkm] [ 549.468257] r535_gsp_rpc_push+0x106/0x160 [nvkm] [ 549.473033] r535_gsp_rpc_rm_ctrl_push+0x40/0x130 [nvkm] [ 549.478422] nvidia_grid_init_vgpu_types+0xbc/0xe0 [nvkm] [ 549.483899] nvidia_grid_init+0xb1/0xd0 [nvkm] [ 549.488420] ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5 [ 549.493213] nvkm_device_pci_probe+0x305/0x420 [nvkm] [ 549.498338] local_pci_probe+0x46/ ---truncated---",,,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01ed662bdd6fce4f59c1804b334610d710d79fa0"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/56e6c7f6d2a6b4e0aae0528c502e56825bb40598"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b6b75728c86f60c1fc596f0d4542427d0e6065b"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,

GSP calculates the number of pages to write from the total size of a GSP message. This behavior can be observed from the movement of the write pointer. However, nvkm takes only the size of RPC header and message body as the message size when advancing the read pointer. When handling a two-page GSP message in the non rollback case, It wrongly takes the message body of the previous message as the message header of the next message. As the ""message length"" tends to be zero, in the calculation of size needs to be copied (0 - size of (message header)), the size needs to be copied will be ""0xffffffxx"". It also triggers a kernel panic due to a NULL pointer error. [ 547.614102] msg: 00000f90: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 40 d7 18 fb 8b 00 00 00 ........@.......

The original implementation could trigger a lockdep warning due to a potential deadlock scenario involving nested locks between rhashtable bucket, rq lock, and dsq lock. By relocating the growth check and work scheduling after releasing the rth lock, we break this potential deadlock chain. This change expands the flexibility of rhashtable by removing restrictive locking that previously limited its use in scheduler and workqueue contexts.

In the default configuration (i.e. when `queue_delayed_work` and friends do not specify which CPU to run the work item on), `WQ_UNBOUND` allows the work item to be executed on any CPU in the same node of the CPU it was enqueued on. While this solution potentially sacrifices locality, it avoids contention with other processes that might dominate the CPU time of the processor the work item was scheduled on. This is not just a theoretical problem: in a particular scenario misconfigured process was hogging most of the time from CPU0, leaving less than 0.5% of its CPU time to the kworker. The IDPF workqueues that were using the kworker on CPU0 suffered large completion delays as a result, causing performance degradation, timeouts and eventual system crash. * I have also run a manual test to gauge the performance improvement. The test consists of an antagonist process (`./stress --cpu 2`) consuming as much of CPU 0 as possible. This process is run under `taskset 01` to bind it to CPU0, and its priority is changed with `chrt -pQ 9900 10000 ${pid}` and `renice -n -20 ${pid}` after start. Then, the IDPF driver is forced to prefer CPU0 by editing all calls to `queue_delayed_work`, `mod_delayed_work`, etc... to use CPU 0. Finally, `ktraces` for the workqueue events are collected. Without the current patch, the antagonist process can force arbitrary delays between `workqueue_queue_work` and `workqueue_execute_start`, that in my tests were as high as `30ms`. With the current patch applied, the workqueue can be migrated to another unloaded CPU in the same node, and, keeping everything else equal, the maximum delay I could see was `6us`.",,,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66bf9b3d9e1658333741f075320dc8e7cd6f8d09"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/868202ec3854e13de1164e4a3e25521194c5af72"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a5b021cb8186f1854bac2812bd4f396bb1e881c"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,

For struct_ops that has a ""struct module *owner"" member, it can be extended either by the regular kernel module or by the bpf_struct_ops. bpf_try_module_get() will be used to do the refcounting and different refcount is done based on the owner pointer.

If the index is ""bad"", the nospec clamping will generate '0', i.e. KVM will return vCPU0 instead of NULL. In practice, the bug is unlikely to cause problems, as it will only come into play if userspace or the guest is buggy or misbehaving, e.g. KVM may send interrupts to vCPU0 instead of dropping them on the floor. However, returning vCPU0 when it shouldn't exist per online_vcpus is problematic now that KVM uses an xarray for the vCPUs array, as KVM needs to insert into the xarray before publishing the vCPU to userspace (see commit c5b077549136 (""KVM: Convert the kvm->vcpus array to a xarray"")), i.e. before vCPU creation is guaranteed to succeed. As a result, incorrectly providing access to vCPU0 will trigger a use-after-free if vCPU0 is dereferenced and kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu() bails out of vCPU creation due to an error and frees vCPU0. Commit afb2acb2e3a3 (""KVM: Fix vcpu_array[0] races"") papered over that issue, but in doing so introduced an unsolvable teardown conundrum. Preventing accesses to vCPU0 before it's fully online will allow reverting commit afb2acb2e3a3, without re-introducing the vcpu_array[0] UAF race.","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.14.120"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.15"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4109C9C5-7A19-4EF4-A583-38A5932C1353""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.19.44"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.20"",""matchCriteriaId"":""A475630C-76E9-48B4-9632-05B9FE32975D""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.0.17"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.4.291"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F6AC9536-80D5-49D5-85E1-6D638B7A423C""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.5"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.10.235"",""matchCriteriaId"":""545121FA-DE31-4154-9446-C2000FB4104D""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.11"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.15.179"",""matchCriteriaId"":""C708062C-4E1B-465F-AE6D-C09C46400875""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.16"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.1.129"",""matchCriteriaId"":""2DA5009C-C9B9-4A1D-9B96-78427E8F232C""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.2"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.6.78"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0C58261F-EDFB-4A12-8CCD-F12101482030""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.7"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.14"",""matchCriteriaId"":""033BB7EE-C9A2-45EA-BAC9-87BB9D951BCD""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.13"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.13.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0E92CEE3-1FC3-4AFC-A513-DEDBA7414F00""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09d50ccf0b2d739db4a485b08afe7520a4402a63"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/125da53b3c0c9d7f58353aea0076e9efd6498ba7"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1e7381f3617d14b3c11da80ff5f8a93ab14cfc46"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5cce2ed69b00e022b5cdf0c49c82986abd2941a8"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7c4899239d0f70f88ac42665b3da51678d122480"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ca8da90ed1432ff3d000de4f1e2275d4e7d21b96"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d817e510662fd1c9797952408d94806f97a5fffd"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f2f805ada63b536bc192458a7098388286568ad4"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

Further instrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec jump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the NEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked cond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler: __cond_resched+0x21/0x60 down_timeout+0x18/0x60 acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80 acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100 acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60 acpi_ns_evaluate+0x1cb/0x2d0 acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data+0x156/0x190 acpi_pci_link_set+0x11c/0x290 irqrouter_resume+0x54/0x60 syscore_resume+0x6a/0x200 kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0 __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240 do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180 This is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with the recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the scheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and invokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler enables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above warning at the end. Quite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in triggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not have done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations it's just a question of time. The problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling models. Full preemption is not affected as cond_resched() is disabled and the preemption check preemptible() takes the interrupt disabled flag into account. Cure the problem by adding a corresponding check into cond_resched().",,,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0362847c520747b44b574d363705d8af0621727a"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1651f5731b378616565534eb9cda30e258cebebc"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/288fdb8dcb71ec77b76ab8b8a06bc10f595ea504"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/321794b75ac968f0bb6b9c913581949452a8d992"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/68786ab0935ccd5721283b7eb7f4d2f2942c7a52"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/82c387ef7568c0d96a918a5a78d9cad6256cfa15"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/84586322e010164eedddfcd0a0894206ae7d9317"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b927c8539f692fb1f9c2f42e6c8ea2d94956f921"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,

After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function removal on the bus pertaining to a given link. That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports. The resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because pciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.

For example, consider the following program: __attribute__((__noinline__)) long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len) { return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len); } SEC(""tc"") int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk) { int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data; if ((void *)(p + 1) > (void *)(long)sk->data_end) return TCX_DROP; skb_pull_data(sk, 0); *p = 42; return TCX_PASS; } After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list of such helpers. At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not rejected by verifier. This commit fixes the omission by computing field bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main verification pass. changes_pkt_data should be set if: - subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data returns true; - subprogram calls a global function, for which bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data should be set. The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls: - check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a state when S is fully explored; - when S is fully explored: - every direct helper call within S is explored (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed); - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1). The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data computation.",,,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d572c60488b52882b719ed273767ee3b280413d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/51081a3f25c742da5a659d7fc6fd77ebfdd555be"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/79751e9227a5910c0e5a2c7186877d91821d957d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,
