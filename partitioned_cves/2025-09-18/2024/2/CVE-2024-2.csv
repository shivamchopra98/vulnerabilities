This issue is particularly concerning for APIs that rely on usernames as input parameters, such as PUT /api/v1/users/test_race, where it could lead to further complications.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-366""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-362""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:zenml:zenml:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""0.55.5"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E8D29AD1-72A6-48F0-97BB-824EB4A40338""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/commit/afcaf741ef9114c9b32f722f101b97de3d8d147b"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/6199cd5d-611f-4ea9-96c5-52a952ba5a56"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/commit/afcaf741ef9114c9b32f722f101b97de3d8d147b"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/6199cd5d-611f-4ea9-96c5-52a952ba5a56"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"",""baseScore"":3.1,""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.5,""impactScore"":2.5}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"",""baseScore"":3.1,""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.5,""impactScore"":2.5}]"

The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input for the `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file system paths. This flaw enables direct arbitrary file uploads, leakage of `personal_data`, and overwriting of configurations in `lollms-webui`->`configs` by exploiting the same named directory in `personal_data`. The issue affects the latest version of the application and is fixed in version 9.4.

All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started. The dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question. On one hand, this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large file that causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand, this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow. The file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks, if these diagnostics are accessible to unprivileged users. In the case of libdnf5, no such user accessible diagnostics should exist, though. Also, a local attacker can place a valid repository configuration file in this directory. This configuration file allows to specify a plethora of additional configuration options.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of file paths during the extraction of tar files, as demonstrated in multiple occurrences within the library's codebase, including but not limited to the files_util.py and extract_imagenet.py scripts.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-29""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-22""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:djl:deep_java_library:0.26.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""99799B59-3597-48CF-8D22-710F764A2D3D""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl/commit/5235be508cec9e8cb6f496a4ed2fa40e4f62c370"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/b064bd2f-bf6e-4fc0-898e-7d02a9b97e24"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl/commit/5235be508cec9e8cb6f496a4ed2fa40e4f62c370"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/b064bd2f-bf6e-4fc0-898e-7d02a9b97e24"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]"

This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query string, highlighting the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to prevent LFI attacks.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-29""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-22""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:lfprojects:mlflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.11.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""C3A84D8C-5A9A-481D-9EF8-55C0B3A03F4C""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/96f0b573a73d8eedd6735a2ce26e08859527be07"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/19bf02d7-6393-4a95-b9d0-d6d4d2d8c298"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/96f0b573a73d8eedd6735a2ce26e08859527be07"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/19bf02d7-6393-4a95-b9d0-d6d4d2d8c298"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]"
