This issue may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPC with at least one other container, can create a large number of IPC resources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaust resources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the malicious container's cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not. Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removed until all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious container is holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, either automatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasing the amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restart always, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in a memory-based denial of service of the system.","[{""source"":""secalert@redhat.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-400""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:podman_project:podman:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""5.2.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""42738F8A-F4CA-4B43-9C33-4EFEF7E5EEB0""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""932D137F-528B-4526-9A89-CD59FA1AB0FE""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F4CFF558-3C47-480D-A2F0-BABF26042943""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7F6FB57C-2BC7-487C-96DD-132683AEB35D""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:40:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""CA277A6C-83EC-4536-9125-97B84C4FAF59""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3056"",""source"":""secalert@redhat.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2270717"",""source"":""secalert@redhat.com"",""tags"":[""Issue Tracking""]},{""url"":""https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241227-0002/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""secalert@redhat.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.7,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.3,""impactScore"":5.8},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":4.8,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.2,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,

The vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited to abuse the Web Explorer server as a proxy for web attacks on third parties and interact with servers in the local network, including reading their response data. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the local services. The vulnerability is limited to GET requests, as POST requests are not possible, but the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is significant due to the potential for stolen credentials and state-changing interactions with internal APIs.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-918""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:langchain:langchain:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""0.1.5"",""versionEndExcluding"":""0.2.9"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4103934E-CAC9-4D54-9A36-3029ED822228""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/e62d4895-2901-405b-9559-38276b6a5273"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/e62d4895-2901-405b-9559-38276b6a5273"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.7,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.1,""impactScore"":4.0}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":4.8,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""PHYSICAL"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.4,""impactScore"":4.0}]"

The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-79""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:mintplexlabs:anythingllm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.0.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0D667E32-5A5C-479C-BB81-47F3BCA38C13""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/49f30e051c9f6e28977d57d0e5f49c1294094e41"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/c2895978-364d-412d-8825-c806606bcb85"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/49f30e051c9f6e28977d57d0e5f49c1294094e41"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/c2895978-364d-412d-8825-c806606bcb85"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":8.7,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.3,""impactScore"":5.8}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.3,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.1,""impactScore"":5.2}]"

Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the system where the application is deployed.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-78""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:lollms:lollms_web_ui:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""9.5"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E7DA38B5-6496-47C5-88AF-17C4AF269B59""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/41dbb1b3f2e78ea276e5269544e50514252c0c25"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/0e2bec70-826e-4c24-8015-31921e23fd12"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/41dbb1b3f2e78ea276e5269544e50514252c0c25"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/0e2bec70-826e-4c24-8015-31921e23fd12"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch""]}]",,,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.4,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.5,""impactScore"":5.9}]"

The issue arises from improper input validation when handling HTTP POST requests to the endpoint `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`. Specifically, the application fails to validate or check user input before passing it to the `workspace_thread` Prisma model for execution. This oversight allows attackers to craft a Prisma relation query operation that manipulates the `users` model to change a user's role to admin.

This issue poses a significant risk as it could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information from the chat history of other users.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-284""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:gaizhenbiao:chuanhuchatgpt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""20240919-4"",""matchCriteriaId"":""57443B25-BE0F-460B-A3B8-7678188C00CC""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/ed32fc32-cb8f-4fbd-8209-cc835d279699"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/ed32fc32-cb8f-4fbd-8209-cc835d279699"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":3.6}]"

The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-29""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-22""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:lfprojects:mlflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.12.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""D345B83A-B06E-4568-BD5F-0DA9CA081262""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/f8d51e21523238280ebcfdb378612afd7844eca8"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/8d5aadaa-522f-4839-b41b-d7da362dd610"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/f8d51e21523238280ebcfdb378612afd7844eca8"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/8d5aadaa-522f-4839-b41b-d7da362dd610"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]"
