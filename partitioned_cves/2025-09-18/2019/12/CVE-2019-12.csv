An attacker can use the 'class' property of the JSON request sent to the CLDB to influence the JSON library's decision on which Java class this JSON request is deserialized to. By doing so, the attacker can force the MapR CLDB to construct a URLClassLoader which loads a malicious Java class from a remote path and instantiate this object in the MapR CLDB, thus executing arbitrary code on the machine running the MapR CLDB and take over the cluster. By switching to the newer Jackson library and ensuring that all incoming JSON requests are only deserialized to the same class that it was serialized from, the vulnerability is fixed.

However it is also possible to obtain the keys from a JWK keystore file, by setting the configuration parameter ""rs.security.keystore.type"" to ""jwk"". For this case all keys are returned in this file ""as is"", including all private key and secret key credentials. This is an obvious security risk if the user has configured the signature keystore file with private or secret key credentials. From CXF 3.3.5 and 3.2.12, it is mandatory to specify an alias corresponding to the id of the key in the JWK file, and only this key is returned.

Some parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php and html/graph-realtime.php scripts. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames, disclosing file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files.

Although this requires QoS being enabled, advanced QoS being enabled, and a valid authentication JWT, additional vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-12510) allow an attacker to interact with the entire SOAP API without authentication. Additionally, DNS rebinding techniques may be used to exploit this vulnerability remotely. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat involved. The following limitations apply to the payload and must be overcome for successful exploitation: - No more than 17 characters may be used. - At least one colon must be included to prevent mangling. - A single-quote and meta-character must be used to break out of the existing command. - Parent command remnants after the injection point must be dealt with. - The payload must be in all-caps. Despite these limitations, it is still possible to gain access to an interactive root shell via this vulnerability. Since the web server assigns certain HTTP headers to environment variables with all-caps names, it is possible to insert a payload into one such header and reference the subsequent environment variable in the injection point.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-78""}]}]","[{""operator"":""AND"",""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:netgear:nighthawk_x10-r9000_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.0.4.26"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E309A90C-7B1D-4E76-B1C3-950516C69410""}]},{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:netgear:nighthawk_x10-r9000:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F8103325-69AE-47DE-9546-09068F4F79DB""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://www.ise.io/casestudies/sohopelessly-broken-2-0/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.ise.io/casestudies/sohopelessly-broken-2-0/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,"[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C"",""baseScore"":9.3,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""COMPLETE"",""integrityImpact"":""COMPLETE"",""availabilityImpact"":""COMPLETE""},""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.6,""impactScore"":10.0,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,

When receiving a request, Squid checks its cache to see if it can serve up a response. It does this by making a MD5 hash of the absolute URL of the request. If found, it servers the request. The absolute URL can include the decoded UserInfo (username and password) for certain protocols. This decoded info is prepended to the domain. This allows an attacker to provide a username that has special characters to delimit the domain, and treat the rest of the URL as a path or query string. An attacker could first make a request to their domain using an encoded username, then when a request for the target domain comes in that decodes to the exact URL, it will serve the attacker's HTML instead of the real HTML. On Squid servers that also act as reverse proxies, this allows an attacker to gain access to features that only reverse proxies can use, such as ESI.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-20""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:squid-cache:squid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""4.7"",""matchCriteriaId"":""A5584C95-5CB1-4D45-8C05-633746AE2AB4""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:16.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F7016A2A-8365-4F1A-89A2-7A19F2BCAE5B""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""23A7C53F-B80F-4E6A-AFA9-58EEA84BE11D""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DEECE5FC-CACF-4496-A3E7-164736409252""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""07B237A9-69A3-4A9C-9DA0-4E06BD37AE73""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commits/v4"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://gitlab.com/jeriko.one/security/-/blob/master/squid/CVEs/CVE-2019-12520.txt"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00009.html"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210205-0006/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://usn.ubuntu.com/4446-1/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4682"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commits/v4"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://gitlab.com/jeriko.one/security/-/blob/master/squid/CVEs/CVE-2019-12520.txt"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00009.html"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210205-0006/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://usn.ubuntu.com/4446-1/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4682"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,"[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.0,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":10.0,""impactScore"":2.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,

The vulnerability is due to an improper check performed by the area of code that manages the REST API authentication service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious HTTP requests to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the token-id of an authenticated user.

The vulnerability is due to ineffective management of the underlying filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing specific actions that result in messages being sent to specific operating system log files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available filesystem space on an affected device. This could cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition for clients whose network traffic is transiting the device. Upon reload of the device, the impacted filesystem space is cleared, and the device will return to normal operation. However, continued exploitation of this vulnerability could cause subsequent forced crashes and reloads, which could lead to an extended DoS condition.","[{""source"":""psirt@cisco.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-400""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-Other""}]}]","[{""operator"":""AND"",""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F821EBD7-91E2-4460-BFAF-18482CF6CB8C""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""57D4F634-03D5-4D9F-901C-7E9CE45F2F38""}]},{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:1100_integrated_services_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""302ACA9E-10A1-4BB0-82BA-BA77A2DD8CF0""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:4221_integrated_services_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""8AE2BDB7-BABB-47D6-BF86-3FCA640E2CED""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:4321_integrated_services_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7B0A86DD-0377-472E-B2E7-C4CED9180465""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:4331_integrated_services_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E8E8972E-357F-4484-B9D3-D1E2363C8DFC""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:4351_integrated_services_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0E0B3CA9-E237-4D5A-8C2D-C90E34BFD23C""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:4431_integrated_services_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7EF50955-A90A-4A25-8DDF-98455DC1CD37""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:4451-x_integrated_services_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""90A4475D-D42C-48C0-ACF8-F052F39B64A7""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_1000:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""91209C16-A620-44A0-9134-8AA456343F29""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_1001-hx_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""33208B25-0CBB-4E31-A892-60B7B5625155""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_1001-x_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""241EEBD9-76E4-4AE6-96B8-1C1ACD834F17""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_1002-hx_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""CC03A84F-C8F2-4225-9A00-8FA35368CD57""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_1002-x_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""51F2A755-556C-4C5E-8622-96D124319AF7""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_900:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""EA873342-542E-4FC8-9C22-B5A43F9F3E9D""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_900_:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""15A2D364-18BE-49BC-8473-FC33D37AFCC8""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-10sz-pd_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B97DDC45-ABD1-4C8F-A249-0865345637A4""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-12cz-a_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""456C68A8-F3C8-4302-B55A-134979B42045""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-12cz-d_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""17C6733C-F77B-4688-B051-C1557F4D8D41""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-12sz-im_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""489F97AB-5C6D-4AFE-BE5A-ABF7F9ED8B66""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-24sz-im_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""31608C12-FBED-4EAD-96EC-48BC4B356B77""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-24sz-m_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""6D21D9A5-DE8F-4C55-B03F-35C04C270A40""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-24tz-m_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B6CC6206-DF19-4636-84C2-8912E443D122""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-4sz-a_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BE95FEC1-12F3-44FC-B922-CD18CADB42FE""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:asr_920-4sz-d_r:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BE37BC85-7758-4412-A5E6-0F1A19E8776B""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_3650-12x48uq-e:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DB2A5355-BF40-437C-8683-A7A81DEE362C""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_3650-12x48uq-l:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""43F4B90E-3499-45D4-864D-18505E2149F2""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_3650-12x48uq-s:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""1B9BE6BA-6B2D-47C9-B8F1-3C9CE213948D""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_3650-12x48ur-e:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BE5FCCFF-E491-474F-9B86-AB51D8244582""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_3650-12x48ur-l:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""EA8464F8-D6D2-4165-ADE8-B40F7D8556C2""},{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:cisco:cata

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making an ISDN call to an affected device and sending traffic through the ISDN channel prior to successful PPP authentication. Alternatively, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that is configured to exit via an ISDN connection for which both the Dialer interface and the Basic Rate Interface (BRI) have been configured, but the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) password for PPP does not match the remote end.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of Base64-encoded strings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening many SSL VPN sessions to an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials on the affected device to exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite a special system memory location, which will eventually result in memory allocation errors for new SSL/TLS sessions to the device, preventing successful establishment of these sessions.
