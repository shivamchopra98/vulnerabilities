CVE-2017-10605,sirt@juniper.net,2017-07-17T13:18:18.767,2025-04-20T01:37:25.860,Deferred,[],"On all vSRX and SRX Series devices, when the DHCP or DHCP relay is configured, specially crafted packet might cause the flowd process to crash, halting or interrupting traffic from flowing through the device(s). Repeated crashes of the flowd process may constitute an extended denial of service condition for the device(s). If the device is configured in high-availability, the RG1+ (data-plane) will fail-over to the secondary node. If the device is configured in stand-alone, there will be temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restored automatically. Sustained crafted packets may cause the secondary failover node to fail back, or fail completely, potentially halting flowd on both nodes of the cluster or causing flip-flop failovers to occur.

This application is installed on the device and an attacker who can provide the right payload can execute code on the user's system directly. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to all the data that the user has access too. The application uses a dynamic link library(DLL) called ""avilib.dll"" which is used by the application to send binary packets to the device that allow to control the device. One such action that the DLL provides is change password in the function ""sendchangename"" which allows a user to change the Wi-Fi name on the device. This function calls a sub function ""sub_75876EA0"" at address 0x758784F8. The function determines which action to execute based on the parameters sent to it. The ""sendchangename"" passes the datastring as the second argument which is the name we enter in the textbox and integer 1 as first argument. The rest of the 3 arguments are set to 0. The function ""sub_75876EA0"" at address 0x75876F19 uses the first argument received and to determine which block to jump to. Since the argument passed is 1, it jumps to 0x75876F20 and proceeds from there to address 0x75876F56 which calculates the length of the data string passed as the first parameter. This length and the first argument are then passed to the address 0x75877001 which calls the memmove function which uses a stack address as the destination where the password typed by us is passed as the source and length calculated above is passed as the number of bytes to copy which leads to a stack overflow.",,,,,"[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-119""}]}]","[{""operator"":""AND"",""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:ishekar:endoscope_camera_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4D620235-1706-4284-A45B-308C32A8DB90""}]},{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:ishekar:endoscope_camera:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""46805FDE-1451-44FF-86EF-B52C0A39F6ED""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153241/Shekar-Endoscope-Weak-Default-Settings-Memory-Corruption.html"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory"",""VDB Entry""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Shekar_boriscope_sec_issues.pdf"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153241/Shekar-Endoscope-Weak-Default-Settings-Memory-Corruption.html"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory"",""VDB Entry""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Shekar_boriscope_sec_issues.pdf"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]",,"[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P"",""baseScore"":4.6,""accessVector"":""LOCAL"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""PARTIAL""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":6.4,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,

This application is installed on the device and an attacker who can provide the right payload can execute code on the user's system directly. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to all the data that the user has access too. The application uses a dynamic link library(DLL) called ""avilib.dll"" which is used by the application to send binary packets to the device that allow to control the device. One such action that the DLL provides is change password in the function ""sendchangepass"" which allows a user to change the Wi-Fi password on the device. This function calls a sub function ""sub_75876EA0"" at address 0x7587857C. The function determines which action to execute based on the parameters sent to it. The ""sendchangepass"" passes the datastring as the second argument which is the password we enter in the textbox and integer 2 as first argument. The rest of the 3 arguments are set to 0. The function ""sub_75876EA0"" at address 0x75876F19 uses the first argument received and to determine which block to jump to. Since the argument passed is 2, it jumps to 0x7587718C and proceeds from there to address 0x758771C2 which calculates the length of the data string passed as the first parameter.This length and the first argument are then passed to the address 0x7587726F which calls a memmove function which uses a stack address as the destination where the password typed by us is passed as the source and length calculated above is passed as the number of bytes to copy which leads to a stack overflow.",,,,,"[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-119""}]}]","[{""operator"":""AND"",""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:ishekar:endoscope_camera_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4D620235-1706-4284-A45B-308C32A8DB90""}]},{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:ishekar:endoscope_camera:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""46805FDE-1451-44FF-86EF-B52C0A39F6ED""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153241/Shekar-Endoscope-Weak-Default-Settings-Memory-Corruption.html"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory"",""VDB Entry""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Shekar_boriscope_sec_issues.pdf"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153241/Shekar-Endoscope-Weak-Default-Settings-Memory-Corruption.html"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory"",""VDB Entry""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Shekar_boriscope_sec_issues.pdf"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]",,"[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P"",""baseScore"":4.6,""accessVector"":""LOCAL"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""PARTIAL""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":6.4,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,
