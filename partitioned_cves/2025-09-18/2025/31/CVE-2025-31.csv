Prior to version 1.26.2, it's possible to run arbitrary JavaScript on the feeds page. This occurs by combining a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that occurs in `f.php` when SVG favicons are downloaded from an attacker-controlled feed containing `<script>` tags inside of them that aren't sanitized, with the lack of CSP in `f.php` by embedding the malicious favicon in an iframe (that has `sandbox=""allow-scripts allow-same-origin""` set as its attribute). An attacker needs to control one of the feeds that the victim is subscribed to, and also must have an account on the FreshRSS instance. Other than that, the iframe payload can be embedded as one of two options. The first payload requires user interaction (the user clicking on the malicious feed entry) with default user configuration, and the second payload fires instantly right after the user adds the feed or logs into the account while the feed entry is still visible. This is because of lazy image loading functionality, which the second payload bypasses. An attacker can gain access to the victim's account by exploiting this vulnerability. If the victim is an admin it would be possible to delete all users (cause damage) or execute arbitrary code on the server by modifying the update URL using fetch() via the XSS.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.","[{""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-305""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-Other""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update#section-Update-VulnerabilityInfo"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://outpost24.com/blog/crushftp-auth-bypass-vulnerability/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://attackerkb.com/topics/k0EgiL9Psz/cve-2025-2825/rapid7-analysis"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/crushftp-authentication-bypass"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/disclosure-drama-clouds-crushftp-vulnerability-exploitation"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Press/Media Coverage""]},{""url"":""https://www.huntress.com/blog/crushftp-cve-2025-31161-auth-bypass-and-post-exploitation"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/crushftp-flaw-exploited-disclosure/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Press/Media Coverage""]},{""url"":""https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-31161-detect-crushftp-vulnerability"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-31161-mitigate-crushftp-vulnerability"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mitigation"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""10.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""10.8.4"",""matchCriteriaId"":""ABD1B990-3D20-49A1-B62D-60BE724EE83F""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""11.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""11.3.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""832C5DBF-FF1C-447E-812E-063CD844EE07""}]}]}]",,2025-04-07,2025-04-28,"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable.",CrushFTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability,,,

This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file://, smb://, or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-20""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-noinfo""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/9cf0390a52497e273db1a1b613a0e26827aa327c"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/security/advisories/GHSA-c9pr-q8gx-3mgp"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/security/advisories/GHSA-c9pr-q8gx-3mgp"",""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:tauri:plugin-shell:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.2.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""1107CA63-182C-4381-A634-25C5A5529814""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:tauri:plugin-shell:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.2.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""88C5D0C7-512F-4689-BF07-731AC58BAB2A""}]}]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":9.3,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,

In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0).

AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked.

The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby sites that use the `collection()` helper or `$kirby->collection()` method with a dynamic collection name (such as a collection name that depends on request or user data). Sites that only use fixed calls to the `collection()` helper/`$kirby->collection()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the collection name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic collection names, such as `collection('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1.

The Document Conversion Service contains a critical XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in its document conversion functionality. The service processes XML files during the conversion process but fails to disable external entity processing, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This vulnerability could allow attackers to read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or other confidential information. Additionally, depending on the server configuration, this could potentially be used to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by making the server connect to internal services.

The issue affects the parsing of OOXML format files like xlsx, docx and pptx. These file formats are basically zip files and it is possible for malicious users to add zip entries with duplicate names (including the path) in the zip. In this case, products reading the affected file could read different data because 1 of the zip entries with the duplicate name is selected over another but different products may choose a different zip entry. This issue affects Apache POI poi-ooxml before 5.4.0. poi-ooxml 5.4.0 has a check that throws an exception if zip entries with duplicate file names are found in the input file.
