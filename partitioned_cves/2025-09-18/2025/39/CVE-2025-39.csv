One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to support a limit of 0): export TARGET=fq tc qdisc del dev lo root tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000 echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0 echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0). To fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal has been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel. qdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that do not directly use the dequeue handler. The old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to the subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field. However, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also potentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the non gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/52bf272636bda69587952b35ae97690b8dc89941"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a225f44d84b8900d679c5f5a9ea46fe9c0cc7802"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

A kernel buffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples (each of which is an `unsigned int`). For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are copied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned. The problem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return data to userspace fill in the whole `insn->n` samples, so that there is an information leak. There is a similar syzbot report for `do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at the time of writing. One culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for `INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have a specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS` handler. For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if `insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn->n - 1` samples copied to userspace will be uninitialized kernel data. Another culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the ""vm80xx"" driver. It never returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer. Fix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure that uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before handling each instruction.

The panic happens in br_dev_queue_push_xmit() once it receives a corrupted skb with ETH header already pushed in linear data. When it attempts the skb_push() call, there's not enough headroom and skb_push() panics. The corrupted skb is put on the queue by HSR layer, which makes a sequence of unintended transformations when it receives a specific corrupted HSR frame (with incomplete TAG). Fix it by dropping and consuming frames that are not long enough to contain both ethernet and hsr headers. Alternative fix would be to check for enough headroom before skb_push() in br_dev_queue_push_xmit(). In the reproducer, this is injected via AF_PACKET, but I don't easily see why it couldn't be sent over the wire from adjacent network.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as rain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock. Multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len before it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both interrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len beyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.

Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we take the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set in wreq->transferred - which is then returned from ->write_iter(). LONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be quickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream->transferred - but this only works if we've set any of them. Fix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in stream->transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the values. stream->transferred can then be initialised to zero. This was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with cache=none. It splices data to the target file. Once (if) it has used up all the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC. This causes ->write_iter() to fail. However, it was returning wreq->transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought the amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would then try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops when it overran.

Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not honor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that. This problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states that for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state (with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence connections handled by the respective function break, and for future connection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a dysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as well. A kernel message like [ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a is a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state with PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like [ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery is a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered because the ISM driver currently lacks support for it. On a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to the FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU trying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that this can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to PEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the failure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command and executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs as if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not the other one is also possible. Frankly, I don't feel confident about providing an exhaustive list of possible consequences.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1194ad0d44d66b273a02a3a22882dc863a68d764"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/897e8601b9cff1d054cdd53047f568b0e1995726"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/faf44487dfc80817f178dc8de7a0b73f960d019b"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fafaa4982bedb5532f5952000f714a3e63023f40"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

If not, it logs ""ea_get: invalid extended attribute"" and calls print_hex_dump(). Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped: int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)); Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads ""size"" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328). The ""size"" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called ""len"" in print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned type), this is then stored inside a variable called ""int remaining"", which is then assigned to ""int linelen"" which is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump() the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is 18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer() on each iteration: for (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) { linelen = min(remaining, rowsize); remaining -= rowsize; hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize, linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii); ... } The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to the ""ptr+i"" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer to the end of the actual bounds of ""ptr"", eventually an out of bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following for loop: for (j = 0; j < len; j++) { if (linebuflen < lx + 2) goto overflow2; ch = ptr[j]; ... } To fix this we should validate ""EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)"" before it is utilised.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-125""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0beddc2a3f9b9cf7d8887973041e36c2d0fa3652"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16d3d36436492aa248b2d8045e75585ebcc2f34d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d6fd5b9c6acbc005e53d0211c7381f566babec1"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/46e2c031aa59ea65128991cbca474bd5c0c2ecdb"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50afcee7011155933d8d5e8832f52eeee018cfd3"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5263822558a8a7c0d0248d5679c2dcf4d5cda61f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/78c9cbde8880ec02d864c166bcb4fe989ce1d95f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8c31808925b11393a6601f534bb63bac5366bab"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fdf480da5837c23b146c4743c18de97202fcab37"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.2}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.19.325"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.20"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3C960EB7-4E90-49E0-BB92-BE6F1B8CF26F""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.4.287"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.4.292"",""matchCriteriaId"":""16E1C46D-7C0B-4307-928A-8D0ABDF8D1B8""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.10.231"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.10.236"",""matchCriteriaId"":""8F0C4A9A-87C3-4779-923D-5E19C9A26EA9""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.15.174"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.15.180"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B6B383DC-5ED6-4326-885D-2F161A71E2D5""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.1.120"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.1.134"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B9344B2D-88D1-4540-9748-8CC37D3B25C8""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.6.64"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.6.87"",""matchCriteriaId"":""042FFA18-3C6A-4999-AB8F-4F6F5902BEEA""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.11.11"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4CBF5F6E-D446-4CAE-AAA4-413442319824""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.12.2"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.23"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B5C71FC9-A61C-431A-9215-38D09F5A2FF3""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.13"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.13.11"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E7E864B0-8C00-4679-BA55-659B4C9C3AD3""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.14"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.14.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""FADAE5D8-4808-442C-B218-77B2CE8780A0""}]}]}]",,,,,,,,

[kworker/8:1:134] The test system was running a workload with hot unplug happening in parallel. Then kemleak decided to disable itself due to its inability to allocate more kmemleak objects. The debug kernel has its CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_MEM_POOL_SIZE set to 40,000. The soft lockup happened in kmemleak_do_cleanup() when the existing kmemleak objects were being removed and deleted one-by-one in a loop via a workqueue. In this particular case, there are at least 40,000 objects that need to be processed and given the slowness of a debug kernel and the fact that a raw_spinlock has to be acquired and released in __delete_object(), it could take a while to properly handle all these objects. As kmemleak has been disabled in this case, the object removal and deletion process can be further optimized as locking isn't really needed. However, it is probably not worth the effort to optimize for such an edge case that should rarely happen. So the simple solution is to call cond_resched() at periodic interval in the iteration loop to avoid soft lockup.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ef72a7fedc5bca70e8cc980985790de10d407aa"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d2d22a55ffe35c38e69795468a7addd1a80e9ce"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/926092268efdf1ed7b55cf486356c74a9e7710d1"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b80430c194e4a114dc663c1025d56b4f3d0153d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f1f4e95031f84867c5821540466d62f88dab8ca"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a04de4c40aab9b338dfa989cf4aec70fd187eeb2"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1534ae23c2b6be350c8ab060803fbf6e9682adc"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e21a3ddd58733ce31afcb1e5dc3cb80a4b5bc29b"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f014c10d190b92aad366e56b445daffcd1c075e4"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

[CAUSE] The cause is a little complex, firstly the extent tree indeed doesn't have the backref for 594526208. The extent tree only have the following two backrefs around that bytenr on-disk: item 65 key (594509824 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13880 itemsize 33 refs 1 gen 197740 flags TREE_BLOCK tree block skinny level 0 (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE item 66 key (594558976 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13847 itemsize 33 refs 1 gen 197522 flags TREE_BLOCK tree block skinny level 0 (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE But the such missing backref item is not an corruption on disk, as the offending delayed ref belongs to subvolume 934, and that subvolume is being dropped: item 0 key (934 ROOT_ITEM 198229) itemoff 15844 itemsize 439 generation 198229 root_dirid 256 bytenr 10741039104 byte_limit 0 bytes_used 345571328 last_snapshot 198229 flags 0x1000000000001(RDONLY) refs 0 drop_progress key (206324 EXTENT_DATA 2711650304) drop_level 2 level 2 generation_v2 198229 And that offending tree block 594526208 is inside the dropped range of that subvolume. That explains why there is no backref item for that bytenr and why btrfs check is not reporting anything wrong. But this also shows another problem, as btrfs will do all the orphan subvolume cleanup at a read-write mount. So half-dropped subvolume should not exist after an RW mount, and balance itself is also exclusive to subvolume cleanup, meaning we shouldn't hit a subvolume half-dropped during relocation. The root cause is, there is no orphan item for this subvolume. In fact there are 5 subvolumes from around 2021 that have the same problem. It looks like the original report has some older kernels running, and caused those zombie subvolumes. Thankfully upstream commit 8d488a8c7ba2 (""btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshot deletion not triggered on mount"") has long fixed the bug. [ENHANCEMENT] For repairing such old fs, btrfs-progs will be enhanced. Considering how delayed the problem will show up (at run delayed ref time) and at that time we have to abort transaction already, it is too late. Instead here we reject any half-dropped subvolume for reloc tree at the earliest time, preventing confusion and extra time wasted on debugging similar bugs.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/125e94a4b76b7b75d194f85bedd628097d2121f0"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39a93e1c9dbf7e11632efeb20fcf0fc1dcf64d51"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4289b494ac553e74e86fed1c66b2bf9530bc1082"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e403bd8e127d40dc7c05f06ee969c1ba1537ec5"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f83d4c81bda3b7d1813268ab77408f7a0ce691ff"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa086b1398cf7e5f7dee7241bd5f2855cb5df8dc"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fcb1f77b8ed8795608ca7a1f6505e2b07236c1f3"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

That path is unreachable at runtime: after insn 1, we know r0 != 0, but with the sign extension on the jset, we would only fallthrough insn 2 if r0 == 0. Unfortunately, is_branch_taken() isn't currently able to figure this out, so the verifier walks all branches. The verifier then refines the register bounds using the second condition and we end up with inconsistent bounds on this unreachable path: 1: if r0 == 0 goto <exit> r0: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0xffffffffffffffff) 2: if r0 & 0xffffffff goto <exit> r0 before reg_bounds_sync: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0) r0 after reg_bounds_sync: u64=[0x1, 0] var_off=(0, 0) Improving the range refinement for JSET to cover all cases is tricky. We also don't expect many users to rely on JSET given LLVM doesn't generate those instructions. So instead of improving the range refinement for JSETs, Eduard suggested we forget the ranges whenever we're narrowing tnums after a JSET.

Specifically, when nr_open is set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8) and a process calls dup2(oldfd, 1073741880), the kernel attempts to allocate: - File descriptor array: 1073741880 * 8 bytes = 8,589,935,040 bytes - Multiple bitmaps: ~400MB - Total allocation size: > 8GB (exceeding INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647) Reproducer: 1. Set /proc/sys/fs/nr_open to 1073741816: # echo 1073741816 > /proc/sys/fs/nr_open 2.

Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027 systemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the maximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory control groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits since memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked that: 1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum size regardless of memcg accounting 2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can inadvertently trigger massive allocations 3. The resulting allocations (>8GB) are impractical and will always fail systemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value until the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open being set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file descriptors. While processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal operation, certain selftests (like tools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file descriptor limits can trigger this issue. Fix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested allocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to fail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the impractical >8GB memory allocation request.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04a2c4b4511d186b0fce685da21085a5d4acd370"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/237e416eb62101f21b28c9e6e564d10efe1ecc6f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/628fc28f42d979f36dbf75a6129ac7730e30c04e"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/749528086620f8012b83ae032a80f6ffa80c45cd"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f61fa6a2a89a610120bc4e5d24379c667314b5c"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4159c5a90c03f8acd3de345a7f5fc63b0909818"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4f9351243c17865a8cdbe6b3ccd09d0b13a7bcc"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dfd1f4ea98c3bd3a03d12169b5b2daa1f0a3e4ae"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f95638a8f22eba307dceddf5aef9ae2326bbcf98"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

The kernel will queue a memory_failure() work which poisons the related page, unmaps the page, and then sends a SIGBUS to the process, so that a system wide panic can be avoided. However, no memory_failure() work will be queued when abnormal synchronous errors occur. These errors can include situations like invalid PA, unexpected severity, no memory failure config support, invalid GUID section, etc. In such a case, the user-space process will trigger SEA again.

When loading a module, module_frob_arch_sections() tries to figure out the number of PLTs/GOTs that will be needed to handle all the RELAs. It will call the count_max_entries() to find in an out-of-order date which counting algorithm has O(n^2) complexity. To make it faster, we sort the relocation list by info and addend. That way, to check for a duplicate relocation, it just needs to compare with the previous entry. This reduces the complexity of the algorithm to O(n log n), as done in commit d4e0340919fb (""arm64/module: Optimize module load time by optimizing PLT counting""). This gives sinificant reduction in module load time for modules with large number of relocations. After applying this patch, the soft deadlock problem has been solved, and the kernel starts normally without ""Call Trace"".

Similar to the simple rules, complex rules rehash logic suffers from the same problems. This patch fixes the error flow for moving complex rules: - If new rule creation fails before it was even enqeued, do not poll for completion - If TIMEOUT happened while moving the rule, no point trying to poll for completions for other rules. Something is broken, completion won't come, just abort the rehash sequence. - If some other completion with error received, don't give up. Continue handling rest of the rules to minimize the damage. - Make sure that the first error code that was received will be actually returned to the caller instead of replacing it with the generic error code.

The current GSO logic violates this contract by failing to disable the feature for packets with extension headers, such as those used in GREoIPv6 tunnels. This violation results in the device being asked to perform an operation it cannot support, leading to a `skb_warn_bad_offload` warning and a collapse of network throughput. While device TSO/USO is correctly bypassed in favor of software GSO for these packets, the GSO stack must be explicitly told not to request checksum offload.

The host uses this pointer to process all of the TREs between it and the host's local copy of the ring's read pointer. This works when processing completion for chained transactions, but can lead to nasty results if the device sends an event for a single-element transaction with a read pointer that is multiple elements ahead of the host's read pointer. For instance, if the host accesses an event ring while the device is updating it, the pointer inside of the event might still point to an old TRE. If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer pointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed. This behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without 'commit 6f18d174b73d (""bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer is written"")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before updating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to access the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the chance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an event pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed one, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all of the TREs in between the two read pointers. This commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the event points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.

CVE-2025-39791,416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67,2025-09-11T17:15:45.517,2025-09-15T15:22:38.297,Awaiting Analysis,[],"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dm: dm-crypt: Do not partially accept write BIOs with zoned targets Read and write operations issued to a dm-crypt target may be split according to the dm-crypt internal limits defined by the max_read_size and max_write_size module parameters (default is 128 KB). The intent is to improve processing time of large BIOs by splitting them into smaller operations that can be parallelized on different CPUs. For zoned dm-crypt targets, this BIO splitting is still done but without the parallel execution to ensure that the issuing order of write operations to the underlying devices remains sequential. However, the splitting itself causes other problems: 1) Since dm-crypt relies on the block layer zone write plugging to handle zone append emulation using regular write operations, the reminder of a split write BIO will always be plugged into the target zone write plugged. Once the on-going write BIO finishes, this reminder BIO is unplugged and issued from the zone write plug work. If this reminder BIO itself needs to be split, the reminder will be re-issued and plugged again, but that causes a call to a blk_queue_enter(), which may block if a queue freeze operation was initiated. This results in a deadlock as DM submission still holds BIOs that the queue freeze side is waiting for. 2) dm-crypt relies on the emulation done by the block layer using regular write operations for processing zone append operations. This still requires to properly return the written sector as the BIO sector of the original BIO. However, this can be done correctly only and only if there is a single clone BIO used for processing the original zone append operation issued by the user. If the size of a zone append operation is larger than dm-crypt max_write_size, then the orginal BIO will be split and processed as a chain of regular write operations. Such chaining result in an incorrect written sector being returned to the zone append issuer using the original BIO sector. This in turn results in file system data corruptions using xfs or btrfs. Fix this by modifying get_max_request_size() to always return the size of the BIO to avoid it being split with dm_accpet_partial_bio() in crypt_map(). get_max_request_size() is renamed to get_max_request_sectors() to clarify the unit of the value returned and its interface is changed to take a struct dm_target pointer and a pointer to the struct bio being processed. In addition to this change, to ensure that crypt_alloc_buffer() works correctly, set the dm-crypt device max_hw_sectors limit to be at most BIO_MAX_VECS << PAGE_SECTORS_SHIFT (1 MB with a 4KB page architecture). This forces DM core to split write BIOs before passing them to crypt_map(), and thus guaranteeing that dm-crypt can always accept an entire write BIO without needing to split it. This change does not have any effect on the read path of dm-crypt. Read operations can still be split and the BIO fragments processed in parallel. There is also no impact on the performance of the write path given that all zone write BIOs were already processed inline instead of in parallel. This change also does not affect in any way regular dm-crypt block devices.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/52a2c4c60470352acf9cde7a2dfa661c1e67e796"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8864616719b6bbf92356bc89ff544b0cd484c656"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e549663849e5bb3b985dc2d293069f0d9747ae72"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

In such case, DM target drivers must not split BIOs using dm_accept_partial_bio() as doing so can potentially lead to deadlocks with queue freeze operations. Regular write operations used to emulate zone append operations also cannot be split by the target driver as that would result in an invalid writen sector value return using the BIO sector. In order for zoned DM target drivers to avoid such incorrect BIO splitting, we must ensure that large BIOs are split before being passed to the map() function of the target, thus guaranteeing that the limits for the mapped device are not exceeded. dm-crypt and dm-flakey are the only target drivers supporting zoned devices and using dm_accept_partial_bio(). In the case of dm-crypt, this function is used to split BIOs to the internal max_write_size limit (which will be suppressed in a different patch). However, since crypt_alloc_buffer() uses a bioset allowing only up to BIO_MAX_VECS (256) vectors in a BIO. The dm-crypt device max_segments limit, which is not set and so default to BLK_MAX_SEGMENTS (128), must thus be respected and write BIOs split accordingly. In the case of dm-flakey, since zone append emulation is not required, the block layer zone write plugging is not used and no splitting of BIOs required. Modify the function dm_zone_bio_needs_split() to use the block layer helper function bio_needs_zone_write_plugging() to force a call to bio_split_to_limits() in dm_split_and_process_bio().

This function is expected to ensure uniqueness of the Security Parameter Index (SPI) for inbound Security Associations (SAs). However, it can return success even when the requested SPI is already in use, leading to duplicate SPIs assigned to multiple inbound SAs, differentiated only by their destination addresses. This behavior causes inconsistencies during SPI lookups for inbound packets. Since the lookup may return an arbitrary SA among those with the same SPI, packet processing can fail, resulting in packet drops. According to RFC 4301 section 4.4.2 , for inbound processing a unicast SA is uniquely identified by the SPI and optionally protocol. Reproducing the Issue Reliably: To consistently reproduce the problem, restrict the available SPI range in charon.conf : spi_min = 0x10000000 spi_max = 0x10000002 This limits the system to only 2 usable SPI values. Next, create more than 2 Child SA. each using unique pair of src/dst address. As soon as the 3rd Child SA is initiated, it will be assigned a duplicate SPI, since the SPI pool is already exhausted. With a narrow SPI range, the issue is consistently reproducible. With a broader/default range, it becomes rare and unpredictable. Current implementation: xfrm_spi_hash() lookup function computes hash using daddr, proto, and family. So if two SAs have the same SPI but different destination addresses, then they will: a. Hash into different buckets b. Be stored in different linked lists (byspi + h) c. Not be seen in the same hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() iteration.

In the comment section of the function, it clearly states that the reference to `cfile` should be dropped after calling this function. 2. Every control flow path would check and drop the reference to `cfile`, except the patched one. 3. Existing callers would not handle refcount update of `cfile` if -ENOMEM is returned. To fix the bug, an extra goto label ""out"" is added, to make sure that the cleanup logic would always be respected. As the problem is caused by the allocation failure of `vars`, the cleanup logic between label ""finished"" and ""out"" can be safely ignored.

When PMU drivers later attempt to use this negative index as a shift exponent in bitwise operations, it leads to UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds reports. The issue is a logical flaw in how event groups handle throttling when some members are intentionally disabled. Based on the analysis and the reproducer provided by Mark Rutland (this issue on both arm64 and x86-64). The scenario unfolds as follows: 1. A group leader event is configured with a very aggressive sampling period (e.g., sample_period = 1). This causes frequent interrupts and triggers the throttling mechanism. 2. A child event in the same group is created in a disabled state (.disabled = 1). This event remains in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF. Since it hasn't been scheduled onto the PMU, its event->hw.idx remains initialized at -1. 3. When throttling occurs, perf_event_throttle_group() and later perf_event_unthrottle_group() iterate through all siblings, including the disabled child event. 4. perf_event_throttle()/unthrottle() are called on this inactive child event, which then call event->pmu->start()/stop(). 5. The PMU driver receives the event with hw.idx == -1 and attempts to use it as a shift exponent. e.g., in macros like PMCNTENSET(idx), leading to the UBSAN report. The throttling mechanism attempts to start/stop events that are not actively scheduled on the hardware. Move the state check into perf_event_throttle()/perf_event_unthrottle() so that inactive events are skipped entirely. This ensures only active events with a valid hw.idx are processed, preventing undefined behavior and silencing UBSAN warnings. The corrected check ensures true before proceeding with PMU operations. The problem can be reproduced with the syzkaller reproducer:",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b64fdd422a85025b5e91ead794db9d3ef970e369"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d689135aa9c5e4e0eab5a92bbe35dab0c8d6677f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

During hidinput_connect() all input and output reports are processed and corresponding hid_inputs are allocated and configured via hidinput_configure_usages(). This process involves slot tagging report fields and configuring usages by setting relevant bits in the capability bitmaps. However it is possible that the capability bitmaps are not set at all leading to the subsequent hidinput_has_been_populated() check to fail leading to the freeing of the hid_input and the underlying input device. This becomes problematic because a malicious HID device like a ASUS ROG N-Key keyboard can trigger the above scenario via a specially crafted descriptor which then leads to a user-after-free when the name of the freed input device is written to later on after hid_hw_start().

The message has ATMTCP_HDR_MAGIC in atmtcp_control.hdr.length. Also, a pointer of struct atm_vcc is set to atmtcp_control.vcc. The notable thing is struct atmtcp_control is uAPI but has a space for an in-kernel pointer. struct atmtcp_control { struct atmtcp_hdr hdr; /* must be first */ ... atm_kptr_t vcc; /* both directions */ ... } __ATM_API_ALIGN; typedef struct { unsigned char _[8]; } __ATM_API_ALIGN atm_kptr_t; The special message is processed in atmtcp_recv_control() called from atmtcp_c_send(). atmtcp_c_send() is vcc->dev->ops->send() and called from 2 paths: 1. .ndo_start_xmit() (vcc->send() == atm_send_aal0()) 2. vcc_sendmsg() The problem is sendmsg() does not validate the message length and userspace can abuse atmtcp_recv_control() to overwrite any kptr by atmtcp_control.

However, a medium error from disk may also return ENODATA. At best, this medium error may escape to userspace as ""attribute not found"" when in fact it's an IO (disk) error. At worst, we may oops in xfs_attr_leaf_get() when we do: error = xfs_attr_leaf_hasname(args, &bp); if (error == -ENOATTR) { xfs_trans_brelse(args->trans, bp); return error; } because an ENODATA/ENOATTR error from disk leaves us with a null bp, and the xfs_trans_brelse will then null-deref it. As discussed on the list, we really need to modify the lower level IO functions to trap all disk errors and ensure that we don't let unique errors like this leak up into higher xfs functions - many like this should be remapped to EIO. However, this patch directly addresses a reported bug in the xattr code, and should be safe to backport to stable kernels. A larger-scope patch to handle more unique errors at lower levels can follow later.

What am I trying to do: This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as compared to 5.10 LTS. - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space ## 2. What is the expected outcome and why - For copyin case: Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return -EFAULT to the process instead of crashing. More specifily, MCE handler checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be recovered. When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space. - For instr case: If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery is possible. User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills by reading from storage. ## 3. What actually happens and why - For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17 Commit 4c132d1d844a (""x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage"") introduced a new extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG. It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user(). - For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI and #MCE race When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when the data is about to be consumed. ### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1] Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action Optional) signature in the machine check bank. This was overkill because it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that bad data. It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE interrupts and finally become an IERR. Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to #CMCI. Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA* signature name. ### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in Intel platform [1] Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors, the memory controller uses it for reads too. But the memory controller is executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference between a ""real"" read and a speculative read. So it will do CMCI/UCNA if an error is found in any read. Thus: 1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a speculative read. 2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read request 3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the core that will soon try to retire the load from address A. Quite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory controller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction reading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page (marking it as poison). ## Why user process is killed for instr case Commit 046545a661af (""mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported ""not ---truncated---",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b8388e97ba6a8c033f9a8b5565af41af07f9345"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a15bb8303b6b104e78028b6c68f76a0d4562134"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e3d8169c0950a0b3cd5105f6403a78350dcac80"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/449413da90a337f343cc5a73070cbd68e92e8a54"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5724654a084f701dc64b08d34a0e800f22f0e6e4"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,
