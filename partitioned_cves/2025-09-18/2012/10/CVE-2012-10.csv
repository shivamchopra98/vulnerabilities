When parsing a crafted .plf file, the MediaPlayerCtrl.dll component invokes PathFindFileNameA() to extract a filename from a URL-like string. The returned value is then copied to a fixed-size stack buffer using an inline strcpy call without bounds checking. If the input exceeds the buffer size, this leads to a stack overflow and potential arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.","[{""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-121""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/blazedvd_hdtv_bof.rb"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://web.archive.org/web/20100302202333/https://blazevideo.com/help_center/hdtv-help/Technical-Support.html"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18693"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/22931"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/23052"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/blazevideo-hdtv-player-pro-filename-handling-buffer-overflow"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""}]",,,,,,,,,,"[{""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":8.6,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""ACTIVE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,
