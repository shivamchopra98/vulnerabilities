The message reply containing the leaked message content is visible to IRC channel members when this happens. matrix-appservice-irc 2.0.0 checks whether the user has permission to view an event before constructing a reply.

The Dusk plugin provides some special routes as part of its testing framework to allow a browser environment (such as headless Chrome) to act as a user in the Backend or User plugin without having to go through authentication. This route is `[[URL]]/_dusk/login/[[USER ID]]/[[MANAGER]]` - where `[[URL]]` is the base URL of the site, `[[USER ID]]` is the ID of the user account and `[[MANAGER]]` is the authentication manager (either `backend` for Backend, or `user` for the User plugin). If a configuration of a site using the Dusk plugin is set up in such a way that the Dusk plugin is available publicly and the test cases in Dusk are run with live data, this route may potentially be used to gain access to any user account in either the Backend or User plugin without authentication. As indicated in the `README`, this plugin should only be used in development and should *NOT* be used in a production instance. It is specifically recommended that the plugin be installed as a development dependency only in Composer. In order to remediate this issue, the special routes used above will now no longer be registered unless the `APP_ENV` environment variable is specifically set to `dusk`. Since Winter by default does not use this environment variable and it is not populated by default, it will only exist if Dusk's automatic configuration is used (which won't exhibit this vulnerability) or if a developer manually specifies it in their configuration. The automatic configuration performed by the Dusk plugin has also been hardened by default to use sane defaults and not allow external environment variables to leak into this configuration. This will only affect users in which the Winter CMS installation meets ALL the following criteria: 1. The Dusk plugin is installed in the Winter CMS instance. 2. The application is in production mode (ie. the `debug` config value is set to `true` in `config/app.php`). 3. The Dusk plugin's automatic configuration has been overridden, either by providing a custom `.env.dusk` file or by providing custom configuration in the `config/dusk` folder, or by providing configuration environment variables externally. 4. The environment has been configured to use production data in the database for testing, and not the temporary SQLite database that Dusk uses by default. 5. The application is connectable via the web.

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning will be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-547""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S4CK4IYTXEOBZTEM5K3T6LWOIZ3S44AR/"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S4CK4IYTXEOBZTEM5K3T6LWOIZ3S44AR/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L"",""baseScore"":3.9,""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.8,""impactScore"":2.7}]",,,,,,,

In affected versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` the `url.full` writes attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests. These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents. Note: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability.

CVE-2024-32030,security-advisories@github.com,2024-06-19T17:15:57.863,2024-11-21T09:14:21.720,Awaiting Analysis,[],"Kafka UI is an Open-Source Web UI for Apache Kafka Management. Kafka UI API allows users to connect to different Kafka brokers by specifying their network address and port. As a separate feature, it also provides the ability to monitor the performance of Kafka brokers by connecting to their JMX ports. JMX is based on the RMI protocol, so it is inherently susceptible to deserialization attacks. A potential attacker can exploit this feature by connecting Kafka UI backend to its own malicious broker. This vulnerability affects the deployments where one of the following occurs: 1. dynamic.config.enabled property is set in settings. It's not enabled by default, but it's suggested to be enabled in many tutorials for Kafka UI, including its own README.md. OR 2. an attacker has access to the Kafka cluster that is being connected to Kafka UI. In this scenario the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to expand their access and execute code on Kafka UI as well. Instead of setting up a legitimate JMX port, an attacker can create an RMI listener that returns a malicious serialized object for any RMI call. In the worst case it could lead to remote code execution as Kafka UI has the required gadget chains in its classpath. This issue may lead to post-auth remote code execution. This is particularly dangerous as Kafka-UI does not have authentication enabled by default. This issue has been addressed in version 0.7.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. These issues were discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is also tracked as GHSL-2023-230.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-94""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-502""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/commit/83b5a60cc08501b570a0c4d0b4cdfceb1b88d6b7#diff-37e769f4709c1e78c076a5949bbcead74e969725bfd89c7c4ba6d6f229a411e6R36"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/pull/4427"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-229_GHSL-2023-230_kafka-ui/"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/commit/83b5a60cc08501b570a0c4d0b4cdfceb1b88d6b7#diff-37e769f4709c1e78c076a5949bbcead74e969725bfd89c7c4ba6d6f229a411e6R36"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/pull/4427"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-229_GHSL-2023-230_kafka-ui/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

Version 24.4.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-89""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-89""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:librenms:librenms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""24.4.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4176B8A1-4185-477D-B978-63C96B4352B3""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://doc.clickup.com/9013166444/p/h/8ckm0bc-53/16811991bb5fff6"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/d29201fce134347f891102699fbde7070debee33"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-cwx6-cx7x-4q34"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://doc.clickup.com/9013166444/p/h/8ckm0bc-53/16811991bb5fff6"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/d29201fce134347f891102699fbde7070debee33"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-cwx6-cx7x-4q34"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":4.2},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,
CVE-2024-32462,security-advisories@github.com,2024-04-18T18:15:09.313,2025-08-21T00:43:47.783,Analyzed,[],"Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9, 1.12.9, 1.14.6, and 1.15.8, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --.

In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-668""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:moby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""26.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""26.0.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DAD660F2-837E-438E-A08A-3B84A00192C1""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7cef0d9cd1cf221d8c0b7b7aeda69552649e0642"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory"",""Mitigation""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7cef0d9cd1cf221d8c0b7b7aeda69552649e0642"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory"",""Mitigation""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":4.7,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.0,""impactScore"":3.6},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":6.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""ADJACENT_NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,

By using ANSI escape sequences and a race between `libc::tcflush(0, libc::TCIFLUSH)` and reading standard input, it's possible to manipulate the permission prompt and force it to allow an unsafe action regardless of the user input. Some ANSI escape sequences act as a info request to the master terminal emulator and the terminal emulator sends back the reply in the PTY channel. standard streams also use this channel to send and get data. For example the `\033[6n` sequence requests the current cursor position. These sequences allow us to append data to the standard input of Deno.

Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert.

Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore. If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.

It supports exporting and importing backups, as a way to let users move their data to a new device effortlessly. However, in versions 0.13.4 through 0.26.1, importing a backup file from an untrusted source could have resulted in Arbitrary Code Execution. This is because backups are serialized/deserialized using Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, which can allow constructing any class in the app, unless properly restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to build a backup file containing the exploit, and then persuade a user into importing it. During the import process, the malicious code would be executed, possibly crashing the app, stealing user data from the NewPipe app, performing nasty actions through Android APIs, and attempting Android JVM/Sandbox escapes through vulnerabilities in the Android OS. The attack can take place only if the user imports a malicious backup file, so an attacker would need to trick a user into importing a backup file from a source they can control. The implementation details of the malicious backup file can be independent of the attacked user or the device they are being run on, and do not require additional privileges. All NewPipe versions from 0.13.4 to 0.26.1 are vulnerable. NewPipe version 0.27.0 fixes the issue by doing the following: Restrict the classes that can be deserialized when calling Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, by adding a whitelist with only innocuous data-only classes that can't lead to Arbitrary Code Execution; deprecate backups serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol; use JSON serialization for all newly created backups (but still include an alternative file serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol in the backup zip for backwards compatibility); show a warning to the user when attempting to import a backup where the only available serialization mode is Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol (note that in the future this serialization mode will be removed completely).","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-502""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/protocol.html"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/commit/a69bbab73220f36e53c801cf7e9ea3627bb017eb"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.27.0"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/security/advisories/GHSA-wxrm-jhpf-vp6v"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/protocol.html"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/commit/a69bbab73220f36e53c801cf7e9ea3627bb017eb"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.27.0"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/security/advisories/GHSA-wxrm-jhpf-vp6v"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"",""baseScore"":8.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":6.0}]",,,,,,,

The full argument value becomes visible when hovering over it with the mouse, as it is displayed in the title attribute of a span tag. However, the use of a double quote ("") allows an attacker to break out of the title attribute's value context and inject their own attributes into the span tag, including malicious JavaScript code through event handlers such as onmousemove.

In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes. An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto's getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-347""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/21201723d2ca9bc11288f62cf72552b7d659b000"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/301"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/445"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-2xp3-57p7-qf4v"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0003/"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/21201723d2ca9bc11288f62cf72552b7d659b000"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/301"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/445"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-2xp3-57p7-qf4v"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0003/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":10.0,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.8}]",,,,,,,

In affected versions there is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. Since the last two vulnerabilities https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g and https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c, we have invested in extensive browser tests. It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues. As of now the project exercises every possible attack vector the developers can think of — including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 known XSS payloads (see: payloadbox/xss-payload-list). The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account just how recklessly permissive browsers are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all minor versions released in the last year. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should configure a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` which would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn. Users unable to upgrade can disable distributed query plan caching to mitigate this issue.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-440""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-670""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/ff9f666598cd17661880fe7fc6e9c9611316e529"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.45.1"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-q9p4-hw9m-fj2v"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/distributed-caching/#distributed-query-plan-caching"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/ff9f666598cd17661880fe7fc6e9c9611316e529"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.45.1"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-q9p4-hw9m-fj2v"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/distributed-caching/#distributed-query-plan-caching"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.0,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":6.0}]",,,,,,,

The Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by: 1. Opening a new libp2p Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works. The larger the response, the more data is enqueued. 2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame. This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued. Under normal circumstances, this queue of pending frames would be drained once they’re sent out over the network. However, the attacker can use TCP’s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never be increased, and the victim won’t be able to send out any new data (this is how TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamux’s queue of pending frames will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying TCP connection is closed. An attacker can cause a remote node to run out of memory, which will result in the corresponding process getting terminated by the operating system.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-400""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""https://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/blob/yamux-v0.13.1/yamux/src/connection.rs#L289"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/security/advisories/GHSA-3999-5ffv-wp2r"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/sigp/rust-yamux/commit/6689e227a48258a52347cd1d984adfc94afc6f7a"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/blob/yamux-v0.13.1/yamux/src/connection.rs#L289"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/security/advisories/GHSA-3999-5ffv-wp2r"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://github.com/sigp/rust-yamux/commit/6689e227a48258a52347cd1d984adfc94afc6f7a"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,
