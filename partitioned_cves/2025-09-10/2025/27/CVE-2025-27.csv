CVE-2025-27089,security-advisories@github.com,2025-02-19T17:15:15.800,2025-02-27T20:31:27.267,Analyzed,[],"Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In affected versions if there are two overlapping policies for the `update` action that allow access to different fields, instead of correctly checking access permissions against the item they apply for the user is allowed to update the superset of fields allowed by any of the policies. E.g. have one policy allowing update access to `field_a` if the `id == 1` and one policy allowing update access to `field_b` if the `id == 2`. The user with both these policies is allowed to update both `field_a` and `field_b` for the items with ids `1` and `2`. Before v11, if a user was allowed to update an item they were allowed to update the fields that the single permission, that applied to that item, listed. With overlapping permissions this isn't as clear cut anymore and the union of fields might not be the fields the user is allowed to update for that specific item. The solution that this PR introduces is to evaluate the permissions for each field that the user tries to update in the validateItemAccess DB query, instead of only verifying access to the item as a whole. This is done by, instead of returning the actual field value, returning a flag that indicates if the user has access to that field. This uses the same case/when mechanism that is used for stripping out non permitted field that is at the core of the permissions engine. As a result, for every item that the access is validated for, the expected result is an item that has either 1 or null for all the ""requested"" fields instead of any of the actual field values. These results are not useful for anything other than verifying the field level access permissions. The final check in validateItemAccess can either fail if the number of items does not match the number of items the access is checked for (ie. the user does not have access to the item at all) or if not all of the passed in fields have access permissions for any of the returned items.

A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap overflow. This vulnerability is due to a race condition between a Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the victim's user decoding client and, possibly, perform arbitrary commands on the victim's host by abusing the heap overflow. This vulnerability affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier releases. Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced Video Coding (AVC) mode are affected by this vulnerability. OpenH264 software releases 2.6.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.

A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint, which is designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing path traversal sequences (../, ..\, etc.), the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process, which could include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data.

This can cause a short memory leak but it won't grow per each request but per different operation until the cache evicts DocumentNode by LRU mechanism.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-400""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-401""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/security/advisories/GHSA-rr4x-crhf-8886"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:the-guild:graphql_mesh:0.96.5:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BE510785-F022-4152-8536-1322352F0698""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:the-guild:graphql_mesh:0.96.6:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""2D484264-71CC-4CFC-8959-FC43C8E44D5D""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:the-guild:graphql_mesh:0.96.7:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""42D32CD2-98C5-49CB-A66E-F9F72F560073""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:the-guild:graphql_mesh:0.96.8:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B077BCC7-800F-43F3-AB05-6F7B3C05F0AA""}]}]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":5.1,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""PASSIVE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""LOW"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""LOW"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,

CVE-2025-27104,security-advisories@github.com,2025-02-21T22:15:13.773,2025-03-28T20:05:35.357,Analyzed,[],"vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop.

Particularly, when the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined, attackers can utilise the special replacement patterns, either `$'` or `$\`` to achieve XSS. The solid-meta package has this issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers, which injects the used assets in the html header. ""dom-expressions"" uses `.replace()` to insert the assets, which is vulnerable to the special replacement patterns listed above. This effectively means that if the attributes of an asset tag contained user-controlled data, it would be vulnerable to XSS. For instance, there might be meta tags for the open graph protocol in a user profile page, but if attackers set the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()`, then they could execute arbitrary javascript in the victim's web browser.

Starting in version 0.52.0 and prior to version 0.54.5, in certain Subsonic API endpoints, a flaw in the authentication check process allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary username that does not exist on the system, along with a salted hash of an empty password. Under these conditions, Navidrome treats the request as authenticated, granting access to various Subsonic endpoints without requiring valid credentials. An attacker can use any non-existent username to bypass the authentication system and gain access to various read-only data in Navidrome, such as user playlists. However, any attempt to modify data fails with a ""permission denied"" error due to insufficient permissions, limiting the impact to unauthorized viewing of information.

Prior to version 1.21, the LocalS3 service's bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. When processing the CreateBucketConfiguration XML document during bucket creation, the service's XML parser is configured to resolve external entities. This allows an attacker to declare an external entity that references an internal URL, which the server will then attempt to fetch when parsing the XML. The vulnerability specifically occurs in the location constraint processing, where the XML parser resolves external entities without proper validation or restrictions. When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from external networks. The server will include the responses from these internal requests in the resulting bucket configuration, effectively leaking sensitive information. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LocalS3 service to exploit this vulnerability.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-611""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/Robothy/local-s3/commit/d6ed756ceb30c1eb9d4263321ac683d734f8836f"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/Robothy/local-s3/security/advisories/GHSA-g6wm-2v64-wq36"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""}]",,,"[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":5.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""LOW"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""PROOF_OF_CONCEPT"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,

Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka ""Alert""), and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround, avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team.

On Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. This library initialization could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. Gradle builds that rely on versions of net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to 0.22-milestone-28 could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. In net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to version 0.22-milestone-28, if the `Native.get(Class<>)` method was called, without calling `Native.init(File)` first, with a non-`null` argument used as working file path, then the library would initialize itself using the system temporary directory and NativeLibraryLocator.java lines 68 through 78. Version 0.22-milestone-28 has been released with changes that fix the problem. Initialization is now mandatory and no longer uses the system temporary directory, unless such a path is passed for initialization. The only workaround for affected versions is to make sure to do a proper initialization, using a location that is safe. Gradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit. Users of Windows or modern versions of macOS are not vulnerable, nor are users of a Unix-like operating system with the ""sticky"" bit set or `noexec` on their system temporary directory vulnerable. This problem was fixed in Gradle 8.12.1. Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug. Some workarounds are available. On Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the ""sticky"" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting. Those who are are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-378""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-379""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab#Options_common_to_all_filesystems"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/32025"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-465q-w4mf-4f4r"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-89qm-pxvm-p336"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/gradle/native-platform/blob/574dfe8d9fb546c990436468d617ab81c140871d/native-platform/src/main/java/net/rubygrapefruit/platform/internal/NativeLibraryLocator.java#L68-L78"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/gradle/native-platform/pull/353"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/gradle/native-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2xxp-vw2f-p3x8"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.0,""impactScore"":6.0}]",,,,,,,,,

In a Kubernetes environment, Ratify can be configured to authenticate to a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted by a vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.3.2. Both Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratify’s Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry. As of versions 1.2.3 and 1.3.2, the Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange. Validation relies upon registry domain validation against a pre-configured list of well-known ACR endpoints. EID token exchange will be executed only if at least one of the configured well-known domain suffixes (wildcard support included) matches the registry domain of the image reference.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-287""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/commit/0ec0c08490e3d672ae64b1a220c90d5484f1c93f"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/commit/84c7c48fa76bb9a1c9583635d1e90bc25b1a546c"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/security/advisories/GHSA-44f7-5fj5-h4px"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""}]",,,"[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":7.2,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""PRESENT"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""PASSIVE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""LOW"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,

Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the client's key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups).

Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox.

Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel).

The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-385""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/24253"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org""},{""url"":""https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org""}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.3,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.6,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,,,

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through <= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases. This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method on the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a malicious header can be used to send the message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application. This could also be seen by using the camel-exec component The attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests that are send to the Camel application. All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box. In these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean. In terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: * camel-activemq * camel-activemq6 * camel-amqp * camel-aws2-sqs * camel-azure-servicebus * camel-cxf-rest * camel-cxf-soap * camel-http * camel-jetty * camel-jms * camel-kafka * camel-knative * camel-mail * camel-nats * camel-netty-http * camel-platform-http * camel-rest * camel-sjms * camel-spring-rabbitmq * camel-stomp * camel-tahu * camel-undertow * camel-xmpp The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"", or ""org.apache.camel."". Mitigation: You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like ""cAmel, cAMEL"" etc, or in general everything not starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"" or ""org.apache.camel."".","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-178""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://camel.apache.org/security/CVE-2025-27636.html"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-21828"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Issue Tracking"",""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://lists.apache.org/thread/l3zcg3vts88bmc7w8172wkgw610y693z"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/09/1"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://camel.apache.org/security/CVE-2025-27636.txt.asc"",""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""tags"":[""Exploit""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/akamai/CVE-2025-27636-Apache-Camel-PoC/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/camel/VulnerableCamel.java"",""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""tags"":[""Product""]}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"",""baseScore"":5.6,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":3.4}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:camel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""3.10.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""3.22.4"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F955C7FA-20EE-44FC-BB7F-2734A731A9DC""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:camel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.8.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.8.5"",""matchCriteriaId"":""15914F75-761B-40AD-8489-EA92699F3741""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:camel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.10.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.10.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DB496A7D-7E5D-48DA-B49F-4494B7369026""}]}]}]",,,,,,,,

Using one of the arbitrary file writes, one can write to `logs/foobar` a `config.json` file, which contains a list of process IDs. Then one can access this endpoint to kill these processes. Since an attacker can't know what process is running on which process ID, they can send a list of hundreds of process IDs, which can kill the process that applio is using to run, as well as other, potentially important processes, which leads to DoS.

When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.

This allows session token replacement for applications hosted on sibling subdomains (e.g., `community.host.com`) if session tokens aren't rotated post-authentication. Key Constraints are that the attacker must control any subdomain under the parent domain (e.g., `evil.host.com` or `x.y.host.com`), and the parent domain must not be on the Public Suffix List.

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"". Apache Kafka allows clients to read an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"" configuratin to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products. Since Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (""-Dorg.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls"") to set the allowed urls in SASL JAAS configuration. In 3.9.1, it accepts all urls by default for backward compatibility. However in 4.0.0 and newer, the default value is empty list and users have to set the allowed urls explicitly.","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-918""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://kafka.apache.org/cve-list"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/09/1"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:kafka:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""3.1.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""3.9.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4D04AEB9-4727-4A0B-85B2-3DCA8BE63570""}]}]}]",,,,,,,,

This requires access to a alterConfig to the cluster resource, or Kafka Connect worker, and the ability to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS config and a SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka clusters since Apache Kafka 2.0.0 (Kafka Connect 2.3.0). When configuring the broker via config file or AlterConfig command, or connector via the Kafka Kafka Connect REST API, an authenticated operator can set the `sasl.jaas.config` property for any of the connector's Kafka clients to ""com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule"", which can be done via the `producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, `consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, or `admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties. This will allow the server to connect to the attacker's LDAP server and deserialize the LDAP response, which the attacker can use to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server. Attacker can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data (or) RCE vulnerability when there are gadgets in the classpath. Since Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users are allowed to specify these properties in connector configurations for Kafka Connect clusters running with out-of-the-box configurations. Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not specify these properties unless the Kafka Connect cluster has been reconfigured with a connector client override policy that permits them. Since Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (""-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules"") to disable the problematic login modules usage in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default ""com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule,com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule"" are disabled in Apache Kafka Connect 3.9.1/4.0.0. We advise the Kafka users to validate connector configurations and only allow trusted LDAP configurations. Also examine connector dependencies for vulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally, in addition to leveraging the ""org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules"" system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector client config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which cannot.","[{""source"":""security@apache.org"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-502""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://kafka.apache.org/cve-list"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/09/2"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:kafka:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.3.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""3.9.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""041AC14A-45CF-478B-9F98-8F20A84608D9""}]}]}]",,,,,,,,

This has the potential for XSS or XSRF. The user is required to be authenticated for this exploit. The management proxy is enabled in Druid's out-of-box configuration. It may be disabled to mitigate this vulnerability. If the management proxy is disabled, some web console features will not work properly, but core functionality is unaffected. Users are recommended to upgrade to Druid 31.0.2 or Druid 32.0.1, which fixes the issue.","[{""source"":""security@apache.org"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-79""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-601""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-918""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://lists.apache.org/thread/c0qo989pwtrqkjv6xfr0c30dnjq8vf39"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Vendor Advisory"",""Issue Tracking""]},{""url"":""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/19/7"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.4,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.3,""impactScore"":2.7}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:druid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""31.0.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""283F37A2-9017-4240-889D-FE908EBAAF05""}]}]}]","[{""source"":""security@apache.org"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":5.8,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""PRESENT"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""ACTIVE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""LOW"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""LOW"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,
