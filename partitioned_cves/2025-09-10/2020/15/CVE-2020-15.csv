A flaw in the implementation of OpenPGP sets the Reset Code to a known value upon initialization. If the retry counter for the Reset Code is set to non-zero without changing the Reset Code, this known value can be used to reset the User PIN.

An attacker could implement an XSS exploit with maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields. This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file. Most TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document. Some TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised. Version 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content is ""sanitized"" before being added to the DOM. For content intended for simple text display, all markup is stripped. Very few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users will automatically begin using the new code**. The only exception would be users who have deliberately edited the embed URL to ""pin"" their timeline to an earlier version of the code. Some users of TimelineJS use it as a part of a wordpress plugin (knight-lab-timelinejs). Version 3.7.0.0 of that plugin and newer integrate the updated code. Users are encouraged to update the plugin rather than manually update the embedded version of TimelineJS.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-79""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-79""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:northwestern:timelinejs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""3.7.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F2C241DA-2468-411B-8EDB-200E505AC655""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3/security/advisories/GHSA-2jpm-827p-j44g"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/posts/"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3/security/advisories/GHSA-2jpm-827p-j44g"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/posts/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.2,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.2,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":4.8,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.7,""impactScore"":2.7}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N"",""baseScore"":3.5,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""SINGLE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""exploitabilityScore"":6.8,""impactScore"":2.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":true}]",,,,,,,,

CVE-2020-15104,security-advisories@github.com,2020-07-14T22:15:10.937,2024-11-21T05:04:49.137,Modified,[],"In Envoy before versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, and 1.15.0 when validating TLS certificates, Envoy would incorrectly allow a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name apply to multiple subdomains. For example, with a SAN of *.example.com, Envoy would incorrectly allow nested.subdomain.example.com, when it should only allow subdomain.example.com. This defect applies to both validating a client TLS certificate in mTLS, and validating a server TLS certificate for upstream connections. This vulnerability is only applicable to situations where an untrusted entity can obtain a signed wildcard TLS certificate for a domain of which you only intend to trust a subdomain of.

CVE-2020-15105,security-advisories@github.com,2020-07-10T21:15:10.950,2024-11-21T05:04:49.277,Modified,[],"Django Two-Factor Authentication before 1.12, stores the user's password in clear text in the user session (base64-encoded). The password is stored in the session when the user submits their username and password, and is removed once they complete authentication by entering a two-factor authentication code. This means that the password is stored in clear text in the session for an arbitrary amount of time, and potentially forever if the user begins the login process by entering their username and password and then leaves before entering their two-factor authentication code. The severity of this issue depends on which type of session storage you have configured: in the worst case, if you're using Django's default database session storage, then users' passwords are stored in clear text in your database. In the best case, if you're using Django's signed cookie session, then users' passwords are only stored in clear text within their browser's cookie store. In the common case of using Django's cache session store, the users' passwords are stored in clear text in whatever cache storage you have configured (typically Memcached or Redis). This has been fixed in 1.12. After upgrading, users should be sure to delete any clear text passwords that have been stored. For example, if you're using the database session backend, you'll likely want to delete any session record from the database and purge that data from any database backups or replicas. In addition, affected organizations who have suffered a database breach while using an affected version should inform their users that their clear text passwords have been compromised. All organizations should encourage users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites where they were used. As a workaround, wwitching Django's session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue, but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-312""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-312""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:django_two-factor_authentication_project:django_two-factor_authentication:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.12"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7D3A415A-770B-405A-9C77-72D6142C79C4""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#112---2020-07-08"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth/commit/454fd9842fa6e8bb772dbf0943976bc8e3335359"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-vhr6-pvjm-9qwf"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#112---2020-07-08"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth/commit/454fd9842fa6e8bb772dbf0943976bc8e3335359"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-vhr6-pvjm-9qwf"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.4,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.2,""impactScore"":4.2},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.4,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.2,""impactScore"":4.2}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N"",""baseScore"":3.6,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""HIGH"",""authentication"":""SINGLE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":4.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":true}]",,,,,,,,

Allowing HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.4 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.9.3 (for the current 2.9 branch). In these versions, help text will be escaped to prevent the inclusion of HTML tags. Site owners who wish to re-enable the use of HTML within help text (and are willing to accept the risk of this being exploited by editors) may set WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True in their configuration settings. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can secure their form page templates by rendering forms field-by-field as per Django's documentation, but omitting the |safe filter when outputting the help text.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-79""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-79""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.7"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.7.4"",""matchCriteriaId"":""2220EE02-4D15-4969-85A0-73492983333E""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.9"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.9.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""937BB6AA-059B-403B-908B-52FB905FFD77""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.help_text"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/contrib/forms/index.html#usage"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/master/docs/releases/2.9.3.rst"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/d9a41e7f24d08c024acc9a3094940199df94db34"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-2473-9hgq-j7xw"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.help_text"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/contrib/forms/index.html#usage"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/master/docs/releases/2.9.3.rst"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/d9a41e7f24d08c024acc9a3094940199df94db34"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-2473-9hgq-j7xw"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.7,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.5,""impactScore"":5.2},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.4,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.3,""impactScore"":2.7}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N"",""baseScore"":3.5,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""SINGLE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""exploitabilityScore"":6.8,""impactScore"":2.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":true}]",,,,,,,,

A malicious USB device can trigger disclosure of unrelated kernel memory to userspace applications on the host, or can cause the kernel to crash. Kernel memory disclosure is especially likely on 32-bit kernels; 64-bit kernels are more likely to crash on attempted exploitation. It is not believed that kernel memory corruption is possible, or that unattended kernel memory disclosure without the collaboration of a userspace program running on the host is possible. The vulnerability is in `HoRNDIS::receivePacket`. `msg_len`, `data_ofs`, and `data_len` can be controlled by an attached USB device, and a negative value of `data_ofs` can bypass the check for `(data_ofs + data_len + 8) > msg_len`, and subsequently can cause a wild pointer copy in the `mbuf_copyback` call. The software is not maintained and no patches are planned. Users of multi-tenant systems with HoRNDIS installed should only connect trusted USB devices to their system.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-190""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-190""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:horndis_project:horndis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""05E6EE2C-2699-4883-8F92-2BFCBD7C4DA2""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS/security/advisories/GHSA-8q4r-m3rh-57jx"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS/security/advisories/GHSA-8q4r-m3rh-57jx"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":5.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""PHYSICAL"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.3,""impactScore"":5.2},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":5.9,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""PHYSICAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.7,""impactScore"":5.2}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P"",""baseScore"":3.6,""accessVector"":""LOCAL"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""PARTIAL""},""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":4.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,

If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd resolver will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases, this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account. The default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.2.14. containerd 1.3 and later are not affected. If you are using containerd 1.3 or later, you are not affected. If you are using cri-containerd in the 1.2 series or prior, you should ensure you only pull images from trusted sources. Other container runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the default resolver (such as Docker) are not affected.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-522""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-522""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""1.2.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.2.14"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0C304363-533E-4DA0-9F40-93E6D86E59CD""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""456DE836-AA57-4EFD-A86C-605C7E3F2458""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:beta0:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BF7FDBEC-0537-4A66-849D-C713643D2AE0""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F0B14069-915C-4CA6-BF0C-EC9E8182376F""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""CCD383CB-954C-42D3-B1A6-7116BA2CA022""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E34C93C2-DCBD-4F8A-AE8D-4EDF49CE2BAC""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""541DDD1F-302B-41C7-A4EC-362E3AEDEDDF""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""023E3733-2DF7-4272-A373-65FE6F1C123D""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:1.3.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BBF42CAF-4E8D-46ED-9C14-1EFA57721A72""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:16.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F7016A2A-8365-4F1A-89A2-7A19F2BCAE5B""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""23A7C53F-B80F-4E6A-AFA9-58EEA84BE11D""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:20.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""902B8056-9E37-443B-8905-8AA93E2447FB""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""07B237A9-69A3-4A9C-9DA0-4E06BD37AE73""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.2.14"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third

To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-20""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-Other""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:ctrip:apollo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.7.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""FFAD5744-07B2-4E40-8CB5-FBC64D66E4A4""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/pull/3233/commits/ae9ba6cfd32ed80469f162e5e3583e2477862ddf"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/pull/3233/commits/ae9ba6cfd32ed80469f162e5e3583e2477862ddf"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"",""baseScore"":7.0,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":4.7},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"",""baseScore"":7.0,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":4.7}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P"",""baseScore"":6.8,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""PARTIAL""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.6,""impactScore"":6.4,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,

As a possible workaround make sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-74""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-694""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-Other""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.16.11"",""matchCriteriaId"":""455BCCE5-1D43-4E59-9591-E84B52DAAF0B""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""3.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""3.3.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B462D769-3FC0-4079-8B48-863F013662EF""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/6aab63765f99050b115f0aec3d6350c85e8da946"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/ac7c07c37d87e09797f714fb57aa5e9cb99d9450"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/b0296c0522e837d65f944beefa3fb64fd08ac304"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/c8d6b01d72c9604e43ee70d0d78fadd54c2d8499"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/d9ef5ce8bad512e325390c0011be1244b8380e4b"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/f2ede29480b507b7d8bb152dd8b6b86248b00658"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c52f-pq47-2r9j"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/d9ef5ce8bad512e325390c0011be1244b8380e4b"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c52f-pq47-2r9j"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":3.0,""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.3,""impactScore"":1.4},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"",""baseScore"":4.7,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.2,""impactScore"":3.4}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P"",""baseScore"":6.5,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""SINGLE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""PARTIAL""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.0,""impactScore"":6.4,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,

However, the only check that the converted index is now valid is only present in debug builds. If the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution moves ahead with a negative index. This, in turn, results in accessing data out of bounds which results in segfaults and/or data corruption.

This can be achieved by changing a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`.

CVE-2020-15211,security-advisories@github.com,2020-09-25T19:15:16.400,2024-11-21T05:05:05.877,Modified,[],"In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue is patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83), and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-125""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-787""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.15.4"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7A5421A9-693F-472A-9A21-43950C884C77""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.0.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B0FEB74E-5E54-4A2F-910C-FA1812C73DB2""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.1.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.1.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""47D83682-6615-49BC-8043-F36B9D017578""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.2.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.2.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""323B716A-E8F7-4CDA-B8FD-A56977D59C02""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.3.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.3.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""C09502A8-B667-4867-BEBD-40333E98A601""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B009C22E-30A4-4288-BCF6-C3E81DEAF45A""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Mailing

However, if the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-119""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-770""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-770""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.2.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.2.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""323B716A-E8F7-4CDA-B8FD-A56977D59C02""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.3.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.3.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""C09502A8-B667-4867-BEBD-40333E98A601""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L"",""baseScore"":4.0,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":1.4},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L"",""baseScore"":4.0,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":1.4}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P"",""baseScore"":4.3,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""PARTIAL""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.6,""impactScore"":2.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,
CVE-2020-15214,security-advisories@github.com,2020-09-25T19:15:16.713,2024-11-21T05:05:06.337,Modified,[],"In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment sum can trigger a write out bounds / segmentation fault if the segment ids are not sorted. Code assumes that the segment ids are in increasing order, using the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor. This results in allocating insufficient memory for the output tensor and in a write outside the bounds of the output array. This usually results in a segmentation fault, but depending on runtime conditions it can provide for a write gadget to be used in future memory corruption-based exploits. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that the segment ids are sorted, although this only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model.

Due to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization within `unsquashfs`, it is possible to overwrite/create any files on the host filesystem during the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction occurs automatically for unprivileged (either installation or with `allow setuid = no`) run of Singularity when a user attempt to run an image which is a local SIF image or a single file containing a squashfs filesystem and is coming from remote sources `library://` or `shub://`. Image build is also impacted in a more serious way as it can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to overwrite/create files leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage` are triggering the squashfs extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.4. All users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.4 especially if they use Singularity mainly for building image as root user. There is no solid workaround except to temporary avoid to use unprivileged mode with single file images in favor of sandbox images instead. Regarding image build, temporary avoid to build from `library` and `shub` sources and as much as possible use `--fakeroot` or a VM for that.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-22""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""3.1.1"",""versionEndIncluding"":""3.6.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""EB8C4D6B-DFE7-4904-8C9C-25D5060F66BC""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:opensuse:backports_sle:15.0:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""67E82302-4B77-44F3-97B1-24C18AC4A35D""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B620311B-34A3-48A6-82DF-6F078D7A4493""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B009C22E-30A4-4288-BCF6-C3E81DEAF45A""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00070.html"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Broken

The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-22""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.5.80"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.5.151"",""matchCriteriaId"":""648B7617-D52A-4CF4-8081-6A5E7C49415A""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-whpv-5xg2-w527"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-whpv-5xg2-w527"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":8.6,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":4.0},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.0,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":10.0,""impactScore"":2.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,

In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in

This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic. For example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to which the process has read access. If instances have individual authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances. If the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload.

This may lead to having accounts addressed to totally different emails, that were verified. Note, that this way one is not able to take over any existing account (guest or normal one). The issue has been patched in Sylius 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3. As a workaround, you may resolve this issue on your own by creating a custom event listener, which will listen to the sylius.customer.pre_update event. You can determine that email has been changed if customer email and user username are different. They are synchronized later on. Pay attention, to email changing behavior for administrators.

On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.

In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the ""host"" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-669""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-669""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.3.9"",""matchCriteriaId"":""AE0C7E47-205B-4949-88A5-E5885F9F3C8B""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""1.4.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.4.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""043B8600-6802-4946-89C1-A3CC3FC50112""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E460AA51-FCDA-46B9-AE97-E6676AA5E194""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""07B237A9-69A3-4A9C-9DA0-4E06BD37AE73""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/4a4bb851f5da563ff6e68a83dc837c7699c469ad"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.3"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Mitigation"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LNKXLOLZWO5FMAPX63ZL7JNKTNNT5NQD/"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-33"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4865"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/4a4bb851f5da563ff6e68a83dc837c7699c469ad"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.3"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mitigation"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LNKXLOLZWO5FMAPX63ZL7JNKTNNT5NQD/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""},{""url"":""https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-33"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4865"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.2,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.0,""impactScore"":2.7},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.2,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.0,""impactScore"":2.7}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N"",""baseScore"":3.6,""accessVector"":""LOCAL"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""LOW"",""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":4.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,

In version 2.10 and earlier, PJSIP transport can be reused if they have the same IP address + port + protocol. However, this is insufficient for secure transport since it lacks remote hostname authentication. Suppose we have created a TLS connection to `sip.foo.com`, which has an IP address `100.1.1.1`. If we want to create a TLS connection to another hostname, say `sip.bar.com`, which has the same IP address, then it will reuse that existing connection, even though `100.1.1.1` does not have certificate to authenticate as `sip.bar.com`. The vulnerability allows for an insecure interaction without user awareness. It affects users who need access to connections to different destinations that translate to the same address, and allows man-in-the-middle attack if attacker can route a connection to another destination such as in the case of DNS spoofing.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-297""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-295""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:teluu:pjsip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""2.10"",""matchCriteriaId"":""107D71AA-CD87-4682-B600-D583CB865E6F""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/67e46c1ac45ad784db5b9080f5ed8b133c122872"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/pull/2663"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-8hcp-hm38-mfph"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-42"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/67e46c1ac45ad784db5b9080f5ed8b133c122872"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/pull/2663"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-8hcp-hm38-mfph"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-42"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.8,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":4.0},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.8,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.2,""impactScore"":4.0}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N"",""baseScore"":4.3,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.6,""impactScore"":2.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,

Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-78""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-78""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:lookatme_project:lookatme:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.3.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""FD795181-94C0-4D6E-BD09-B2F5B2D6A584""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/#history"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/#history"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":9.3,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.8},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C"",""baseScore"":9.3,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""COMPLETE"",""integrityImpact"":""COMPLETE"",""availabilityImpact"":""COMPLETE""},""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.6,""impactScore"":10.0,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":true}]",,,,,,,,

Xen versions 4.7 and earlier are not affected. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using shadow paging can leverage the vulnerability.

When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them require flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs, a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory after changes were made. Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another purpose. Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), having a passed through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing enabled can leverage the vulnerability.

When mapping guest EPT (nested paging) tables, Xen would in some circumstances use a series of non-atomic bitfield writes. Depending on the compiler version and optimisation flags, Xen might expose a dangerous partially written PTE to the hardware, which an attacker might be able to race to exploit. A guest administrator or perhaps even an unprivileged guest user might be able to cause denial of service, data corruption, or privilege escalation. Only systems using Intel CPUs are vulnerable. Systems using AMD CPUs, and Arm systems, are not vulnerable. Only systems using nested paging (hap, aka nested paging, aka in this case Intel EPT) are vulnerable. Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability. The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on the precise optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen. If the compiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series of read-modify-write operations in the same order as the source code, the hypervisor is not vulnerable. For example, in one test build using GCC 8.3 with normal settings, the compiler generated multiple (unlocked) read-modify-write operations in source-code order, which did not constitute a vulnerability. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code-generation options). The source code clearly violates the C rules, and thus should be considered vulnerable.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-362""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""4.13.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""16D16A83-7BD8-4FF1-BCBD-17EF7697D221""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""07B237A9-69A3-4A9C-9DA0-4E06BD37AE73""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B620311B-34A3-48A6-82DF-6F078D7A4493""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B009C22E-30A4-4288-BCF6-C3E81DEAF45A""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""80F0FA5D-8D3B-4C0E-81E2-87998286AF33""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""36D96259-24BD-44E2-96D9-78CE1D41F956""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00024.html"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Mailing

Since 1.5, PIA has supported a “split tunnel” OpenVPN bypass option. The PIA killswitch & associated iptables firewall is designed to protect you while using the Internet. When the kill switch is configured to block all inbound and outbound network traffic, privileged applications can continue sending & receiving network traffic if net.ipv4.ip_forward has been enabled in the system kernel parameters. For example, a Docker container running on a host with the VPN turned off, and the kill switch turned on, can continue using the internet, leaking the host IP (CWE 200).

NOTE: The discoverer reports ""Trustwave has signaled they are disputing our claims."" The CVE suggests that there is a security issue with how ModSecurity handles regular expressions that can result in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not consider this as a security issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here.

Due to incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the browser cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary source. Squid uses a string search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header to find chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to hide a second request inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by Squid as chunked and split out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will then deliver two distinct responses to the client, corrupting any downstream

The folder permissions allow ""Full Control"" to ""Everyone"".

Whenever a user performs a login action from the web interface, the request values are being forwarded to the ssi binary. On the login page, the web interface restricts the password input field to a fixed length of 15 characters. The problem is that validation is being done on the client side, hence it can be bypassed. When an attacker manages to intercept the login request (POST based) and tampers with the vulnerable parameter (log_pass), to a larger length, the request will be forwarded to the webserver. This results in a stack-based buffer overflow. A few other POST variables, (transferred as part of the login request) are also vulnerable: html_response_page and log_user.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-669""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-787""}]}]","[{""operator"":""AND"",""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dap-1520_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""1.10b04"",""matchCriteriaId"":""EECD7723-759E-499C-A784-47C3021D0E2D""}]},{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:h:dlink:dap-1520:a1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""FBCD8191-9FE0-455F-B85E-ECE69D678F8C""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://research.loginsoft.com/bugs/classic-stack-based-buffer-overflow-in-dlink-firmware-dap-1520/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10169"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://research.loginsoft.com/bugs/classic-stack-based-buffer-overflow-in-dlink-firmware-dap-1520/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10169"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P"",""baseScore"":7.5,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""LOW"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""PARTIAL""},""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""exploitabilityScore"":10.0,""impactScore"":6.4,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]",,,,,,,,
