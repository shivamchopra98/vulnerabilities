An attacker can craft a malicious encrypted pic parameter, which, when decrypted, points to internal addresses or local file paths (such as http://127.0.0.1 or file://). By using the file:// protocol, the attacker can access arbitrary files on the local file system (e.g., file:///etc/passwd, file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts), allowing them to read sensitive configuration files, log files, and more, leading to information leakage or system exposure.

Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution.","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-502""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/blob/ab38bff0387a86fd9f068246c326ee7b0d5ed139/swift/hub/utils/caching.py#L141"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org""},{""url"":""https://github.com/xhjy2020/CVE-2025-50472"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org""}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,,,
