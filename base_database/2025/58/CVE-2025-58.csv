As a workaround, OctoPrint administrators who have event handlers configured that include any kind of filename based placeholders should disable those by setting their `enabled` property to `False` or unchecking the ""Enabled"" checkbox in the GUI based Event Manager. Alternatively, OctoPrint administrators should set `feature.enforceReallyUniversalFilenames` to `true` in `config.yaml` and restart OctoPrint, then vet the existing uploads and make sure to delete any suspicious looking files. As always, OctoPrint administrators are advised to not expose OctoPrint on hostile networks like the public internet, and to vet who has access to their instance.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-78""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/commit/be4201ef58d9a7c03593252398c16eada90a258b"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/commit/c3a940962f4658a8e035a00388781b1cbd768841"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.11.3"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/security/advisories/GHSA-49mj-x8jp-qvfc"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""}]",,,"[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""ADJACENT"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""PRESENT"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,

The `real_pms_image_proxy` is used to fetch an image directly from the backing Plex Media Server. The image to be fetched is specified through an `img` URL parameter, which can either be a URL or a file path. There is some validation ensuring that `img` begins with the prefix `interfaces/default/images` in order to be served from the local filesystem. However this can be bypassed by passing an `img` parameter which begins with a valid prefix, and then adjoining path traversal characters in order to reach files outside of intended directories.

In Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier, an attacker with administrative access can use the `pms_image_proxy` endpoint to write arbitrary python scripts into the application filesystem. This leads to remote code execution when combined with the `Script` notification agent. If an attacker with administrative access changes the URL of the PMS to a server they control, they can then abuse the `pms_image_proxy` to obtain a file write into the application filesystem. This can be done by making a `pms_image_proxy` request with a URL in the `img` parameter and the desired file name in the `img_format` parameter. Tautulli then uses a hash of the desired metadata together with the `img_format` in order to construct a file path. Since the attacker controls `img_format` which occupies the end of the file path, and `img_format` is not sanitised, the attacker can then use path traversal characters to specify filename of their choosing. If the specified file does not exist, Tautaulli will then attempt to fetch the image from the configured PMS. Since the attacker controls the PMS, they can return arbitrary content in response to this request, which will then be written into the specified file. An attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. The attacker can then make use of the built-in `Script` notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server.

A command injection vulnerability in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior allows attackers with administrative privileges to obtain remote code execution on the application server. This vulnerability requires the application to have been cloned from GitHub and installed manually. When Tautulli is cloned directly from GitHub and installed manually, the application manages updates and versioning through calls to the `git` command. In the code, this is performed through the `runGit` function in `versioncheck.py`. Since `shell=True` is passed to `subproces.Popen`, this call is vulnerable to subject to command injection, as shell characters within arguments will be passed to the underlying shell. A concrete location where this can be triggered is in the `checkout_git_branch` endpoint. This endpoint stores a user-supplied remote and branch name into the `GIT_REMOTE` and `GIT_BRANCH` configuration keys without sanitization. Downstream, these keys are then fetched and passed directly into `runGit` using a format string. Hence, code execution can be obtained by using `$()` interpolation in a command.
