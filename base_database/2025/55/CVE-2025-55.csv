In versions below 1.32.10 and 1.33.0 through 1.33.6, 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0, insufficient Session Expiration in the Envoy OAuth2 filter leads to failed logout operations. When configured with __Secure- or __Host- prefixed cookie names, the filter fails to append the required Secure attribute to the Set-Cookie header during deletion. Modern browsers ignore this invalid request, causing the session cookie to persist. This allows a user to remain logged in after they believe they have logged out, creating a session hijacking risk on shared computers. The current implementation iterates through the configured cookie names to generate deletion headers but does not check for these prefixes. This failure to properly construct the deletion header means the user's session cookies are never removed by the browser, leaving the session active and allowing the next user of the same browser to gain unauthorized access to the original user's account and data.

This flaw allowed an attacker to use label selectors to list and read secrets/secret-stores across the cluster, bypassing intended namespace restrictions. An attacker with the ability to create or update PushSecret resources and control SecretStore configurations could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive data from arbitrary namespaces. This could lead to full disclosure of Kubernetes secrets, including credentials, tokens, and other sensitive information stored in the cluster. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.19.2.

Prior to version 1.0.4, it's possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompts to read a file and then send file contents over the network without user confirmation due to an overly broad allowlist of safe commands. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically after release. Current users of Claude Code are unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated and have been forced to update.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-78""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gv-jw7f-j6xj"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""}]",,,"[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":7.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""PASSIVE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,

This differs from the standard alpha mask surface used for the previous super-sample anti-aliasing (SSAA) method. Under certain circumstances where the path being drawn existed in whole or partly outside of the rendering surface, incorrect bounding could cause out-of-bounds access within the coverage buffer. This affects the higher-level drawing operations, such as Context.fill, Context.stroke, painter.fill, and painter.stroke, when either the .default or .multisample_4x anti-aliasing modes were used. .supersample_4x was not affected, nor was drawing without anti-aliasing. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with ReleaseFast or ReleaseSmall), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. z2d v0.7.1 fixes this issue, and it's recommended to upgrade to v0.7.1, or, given the small period of time v0.7.0 has been released, use v0.7.1 immediately, skipping v0.7.0.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-119""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-122""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/commit/93e45d36af53cda0d7f454ed8440713b7ac155b6"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/pull/137"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""},{""url"":""https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/security/advisories/GHSA-2vq8-cp8r-vcf3"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com""}]",,,"[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":7.3,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""attackRequirements"":""PRESENT"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""PASSIVE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""HIGH"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,,
