One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to support a limit of 0): export TARGET=fq tc qdisc del dev lo root tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000 echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0 echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0). To fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal has been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel. qdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that do not directly use the dequeue handler. The old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to the subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field. However, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also potentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the non gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/52bf272636bda69587952b35ae97690b8dc89941"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a225f44d84b8900d679c5f5a9ea46fe9c0cc7802"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

A kernel buffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples (each of which is an `unsigned int`). For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are copied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned. The problem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return data to userspace fill in the whole `insn->n` samples, so that there is an information leak. There is a similar syzbot report for `do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at the time of writing. One culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for `INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have a specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS` handler. For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if `insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn->n - 1` samples copied to userspace will be uninitialized kernel data. Another culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the ""vm80xx"" driver. It never returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer. Fix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure that uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before handling each instruction.

The panic happens in br_dev_queue_push_xmit() once it receives a corrupted skb with ETH header already pushed in linear data. When it attempts the skb_push() call, there's not enough headroom and skb_push() panics. The corrupted skb is put on the queue by HSR layer, which makes a sequence of unintended transformations when it receives a specific corrupted HSR frame (with incomplete TAG). Fix it by dropping and consuming frames that are not long enough to contain both ethernet and hsr headers. Alternative fix would be to check for enough headroom before skb_push() in br_dev_queue_push_xmit(). In the reproducer, this is injected via AF_PACKET, but I don't easily see why it couldn't be sent over the wire from adjacent network.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as rain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock. Multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len before it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both interrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len beyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.

Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we take the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set in wreq->transferred - which is then returned from ->write_iter(). LONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be quickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream->transferred - but this only works if we've set any of them. Fix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in stream->transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the values. stream->transferred can then be initialised to zero. This was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with cache=none. It splices data to the target file. Once (if) it has used up all the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC. This causes ->write_iter() to fail. However, it was returning wreq->transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought the amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would then try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops when it overran.

Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not honor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that. This problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states that for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state (with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence connections handled by the respective function break, and for future connection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a dysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as well. A kernel message like [ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a is a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state with PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like [ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery is a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered because the ISM driver currently lacks support for it. On a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to the FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU trying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that this can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to PEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the failure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command and executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs as if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not the other one is also possible. Frankly, I don't feel confident about providing an exhaustive list of possible consequences.",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1194ad0d44d66b273a02a3a22882dc863a68d764"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/897e8601b9cff1d054cdd53047f568b0e1995726"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/faf44487dfc80817f178dc8de7a0b73f960d019b"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fafaa4982bedb5532f5952000f714a3e63023f40"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,

If not, it logs ""ea_get: invalid extended attribute"" and calls print_hex_dump(). Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped: int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)); Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads ""size"" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328). The ""size"" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called ""len"" in print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned type), this is then stored inside a variable called ""int remaining"", which is then assigned to ""int linelen"" which is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump() the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is 18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer() on each iteration: for (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) { linelen = min(remaining, rowsize); remaining -= rowsize; hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize, linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii); ... } The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to the ""ptr+i"" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer to the end of the actual bounds of ""ptr"", eventually an out of bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following for loop: for (j = 0; j < len; j++) { if (linebuflen < lx + 2) goto overflow2; ch = ptr[j]; ... } To fix this we should validate ""EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)"" before it is utilised.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-125""}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0beddc2a3f9b9cf7d8887973041e36c2d0fa3652"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16d3d36436492aa248b2d8045e75585ebcc2f34d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d6fd5b9c6acbc005e53d0211c7381f566babec1"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/46e2c031aa59ea65128991cbca474bd5c0c2ecdb"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50afcee7011155933d8d5e8832f52eeee018cfd3"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5263822558a8a7c0d0248d5679c2dcf4d5cda61f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/78c9cbde8880ec02d864c166bcb4fe989ce1d95f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8c31808925b11393a6601f534bb63bac5366bab"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fdf480da5837c23b146c4743c18de97202fcab37"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.2}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.19.325"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.20"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3C960EB7-4E90-49E0-BB92-BE6F1B8CF26F""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.4.287"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.4.292"",""matchCriteriaId"":""16E1C46D-7C0B-4307-928A-8D0ABDF8D1B8""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.10.231"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.10.236"",""matchCriteriaId"":""8F0C4A9A-87C3-4779-923D-5E19C9A26EA9""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.15.174"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.15.180"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B6B383DC-5ED6-4326-885D-2F161A71E2D5""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.1.120"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.1.134"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B9344B2D-88D1-4540-9748-8CC37D3B25C8""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.6.64"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.6.87"",""matchCriteriaId"":""042FFA18-3C6A-4999-AB8F-4F6F5902BEEA""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.11.11"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4CBF5F6E-D446-4CAE-AAA4-413442319824""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.12.2"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.23"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B5C71FC9-A61C-431A-9215-38D09F5A2FF3""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.13"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.13.11"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E7E864B0-8C00-4679-BA55-659B4C9C3AD3""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.14"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.14.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""FADAE5D8-4808-442C-B218-77B2CE8780A0""}]}]}]",,,,,,,,

What am I trying to do: This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as compared to 5.10 LTS. - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space ## 2. What is the expected outcome and why - For copyin case: Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return -EFAULT to the process instead of crashing. More specifily, MCE handler checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be recovered. When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space. - For instr case: If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery is possible. User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills by reading from storage. ## 3. What actually happens and why - For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17 Commit 4c132d1d844a (""x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage"") introduced a new extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG. It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user(). - For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI and #MCE race When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when the data is about to be consumed. ### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1] Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action Optional) signature in the machine check bank. This was overkill because it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that bad data. It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE interrupts and finally become an IERR. Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to #CMCI. Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA* signature name. ### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in Intel platform [1] Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors, the memory controller uses it for reads too. But the memory controller is executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference between a ""real"" read and a speculative read. So it will do CMCI/UCNA if an error is found in any read. Thus: 1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a speculative read. 2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read request 3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the core that will soon try to retire the load from address A. Quite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory controller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction reading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page (marking it as poison). ## Why user process is killed for instr case Commit 046545a661af (""mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported ""not ---truncated---",,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b8388e97ba6a8c033f9a8b5565af41af07f9345"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a15bb8303b6b104e78028b6c68f76a0d4562134"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e3d8169c0950a0b3cd5105f6403a78350dcac80"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/449413da90a337f343cc5a73070cbd68e92e8a54"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5724654a084f701dc64b08d34a0e800f22f0e6e4"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,,,
