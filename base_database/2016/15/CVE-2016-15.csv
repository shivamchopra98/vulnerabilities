In versions 0.9.53-1 (Deepin 15.5) and 0.9.66-1 (Deepin 15.7), the D-Bus configuration permits any user in the sudo group to invoke the InstallPackage method without password authentication. By default, the first user created on Deepin is in the sudo group. An attacker with shell access can craft a .deb package containing a malicious post-install script and use dbus-send to install it via lastore-daemon, resulting in arbitrary code execution as root.","[{""url"":""https://github.com/linuxdeepin/lastore-daemon"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/linux/local/lastore_daemon_dbus_priv_esc.rb"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.deepin.org/en/mirrors/releases/"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39433"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44523"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/deepin-lastore-daemon-priv-esc"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39433"",""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0""}]","[{""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-269""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-306""}]}]",,,,,,,,,,,"[{""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":8.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]"
CVE-2016-15046,disclosure@vulncheck.com,2025-07-25T16:15:26.827,2025-07-30T16:15:24.987,Awaiting Analysis,[],"A client-side remote code execution vulnerability exists in Hanwha Techwin Smart Security Manager (SSM) versions 1.32 and 1.4, due to improper restrictions on the PUT method exposed by the bundled Apache ActiveMQ instance (running on port 8161). An attacker can exploit this flaw through a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypass combined with JavaScript-triggered file uploads to the web server, ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. This vulnerability bypasses the server-side mitigations introduced in ZDI-15-156 and ZDI-16-481 by shifting the exploitation to the client-side. This product is now referred to as Hanwha Wisenet SSM and it is unknown if current versions are affected.","[{""url"":""http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-15-156/"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-16-481/"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/windows/browser/samsung_security_manager_put.rb"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2016-0032/"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://web.archive.org/web/20160518205411/http://security.hanwhatechwin.com/product/product_view.asp?idx=6779#FL080000"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/samsung-security-manager-activemq-file-upload-rce"",""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com""},{""url"":""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/windows/browser/samsung_security_manager_put.rb"",""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0""}]","[{""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-306""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-434""}]}]",,,,,,,,,,,"[{""source"":""disclosure@vulncheck.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":8.6,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""ACTIVE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""HIGH"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]"
