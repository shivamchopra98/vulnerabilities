Such an attack could lead to complete system compromise. The ability to transmit traffic to an IP interface on the mobility controller is required to carry out an attack. The attack leverages the PAPI protocol (UDP port 8211). If the mobility controller is only bridging L2 traffic to an uplink and does not have an IP address that is accessible to the attacker, it cannot be attacked.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-20""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.4.4.21"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DDEB8052-8974-4F8B-9C64-DCE9D7C76753""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.5.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.5.4.13"",""matchCriteriaId"":""16F5E9C2-A354-4F33-9D65-2A9FBDE6D085""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""8.0.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""8.2.2.6"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DD6448CB-1D2B-47A4-9F70-0CDBE4F35858""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""8.3.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""8.3.0.7"",""matchCriteriaId"":""E7F19B7F-1E7B-4C6E-AEB5-2755D10CA6CE""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""8.4.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""8.4.0.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""D5152AE7-9D5D-46D8-AC74-11CADDA2B366""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""8.4.0.4"",""versionEndExcluding"":""8.5.0.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""C4420558-9318-4E4C-B607-952F2B9B95E3""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2019-004.txt"",""source"":""security-alert@hpe.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://x-c3ll.github.io/posts/CVE-2018-7081-RCE-ArubaOS/"",""source"":""security-alert@hpe.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2019-004.txt"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://x-c3ll.github.io/posts/CVE-2018-7081-RCE-ArubaOS/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]",,"[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C"",""baseScore"":9.3,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""COMPLETE"",""integrityImpact"":""COMPLETE"",""availabilityImpact"":""COMPLETE""},""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.6,""impactScore"":10.0,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":false}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

When an RTP packet was received, this registry would be consulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP. This registry was incorrectly consulted for all packets, even those which are dynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different type than the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in a video codec but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of that type had been negotiated.

The software installs a privileged helper tool that runs as the root user. This privileged helper tool is installed as a LaunchDaemon and implements an XPC service. The XPC service is responsible for handling new VPN connection operations via the main PrivateVPN application. The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary. When a new VPN connection is established, the privileged helper tool will launch this malicious binary, thus allowing an attacker to execute code as the root user.

The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-79""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""9.2.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DD1A974E-670F-4145-8843-C7F46CE01E63""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/pull/3647"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Issue Tracking"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://membership.backbox.org/glpi-9-2-1-multiple-vulnerabilities/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Permissions Required""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/pull/3647"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Issue Tracking"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://membership.backbox.org/glpi-9-2-1-multiple-vulnerabilities/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Permissions Required""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.1,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""LOW"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":2.7}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""2.0"",""vectorString"":""AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N"",""baseScore"":4.3,""accessVector"":""NETWORK"",""accessComplexity"":""MEDIUM"",""authentication"":""NONE"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""PARTIAL"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""exploitabilityScore"":8.6,""impactScore"":2.9,""acInsufInfo"":false,""obtainAllPrivilege"":false,""obtainUserPrivilege"":false,""obtainOtherPrivilege"":false,""userInteractionRequired"":true}]",,,,,,,,
