CVE-2024-56128,security@apache.org,2024-12-18T14:15:23.277,2025-06-20T18:13:13.550,Analyzed,[],"Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm in Apache Kafka's SCRAM implementation. Issue Summary: Apache Kafka's implementation of the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) did not fully adhere to the requirements of RFC 5802 [1]. Specifically, as per RFC 5802, the server must verify that the nonce sent by the client in the second message matches the nonce sent by the server in its first message. However, Kafka's SCRAM implementation did not perform this validation. Impact: This vulnerability is exploitable only when an attacker has plaintext access to the SCRAM authentication exchange. However, the usage of SCRAM over plaintext is strongly discouraged as it is considered an insecure practice [2]. Apache Kafka recommends deploying SCRAM exclusively with TLS encryption to protect SCRAM exchanges from interception [3]. Deployments using SCRAM with TLS are not affected by this issue. How to Detect If You Are Impacted: If your deployment uses SCRAM authentication over plaintext communication channels (without TLS encryption), you are likely impacted. To check if TLS is enabled, review your server.properties configuration file for listeners property. If you have SASL_PLAINTEXT in the listeners, then you are likely impacted. Fix Details: The issue has been addressed by introducing nonce verification in the final message of the SCRAM authentication exchange to ensure compliance with RFC 5802. Affected Versions: Apache Kafka versions 0.10.2.0 through 3.9.0, excluding the fixed versions below. Fixed Versions: 3.9.0 3.8.1 3.7.2 Users are advised to upgrade to 3.7.2 or later to mitigate this issue. Recommendations for Mitigation: Users unable to upgrade to the fixed versions can mitigate the issue by: - Using TLS with SCRAM Authentication: Always deploy SCRAM over TLS to encrypt authentication exchanges and protect against interception. - Considering Alternative Authentication Mechanisms: Evaluate alternative authentication mechanisms, such as PLAIN, Kerberos or OAuth with TLS, which provide additional layers of security.","[{""source"":""security@apache.org"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-303""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-Other""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:kafka:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""0.10.2.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""3.7.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7358B30A-00B4-4357-9A54-A169438B685D""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:apache:kafka:3.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""EF7C474D-9CB2-441B-9B30-782031AC1576""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]},{""url"":""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802#section-9"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]},{""url"":""https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_scram_security"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Product""]},{""url"":""https://lists.apache.org/thread/84dh4so32lwn7wr6c5s9mwh381vx9wkw"",""source"":""security@apache.org"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/12/18/3"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":5.3,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":1.4}]",,,,,,,

Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation, the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios, particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations.

A bug in the build process allows any unauthenticated user to read parts of the server source code. During build, along with client assets such as css and font files, the sourcemap files **for the server code** are moved to a publicly-accessible folder. Any outside party can read them with an unauthorized HTTP GET request to the same server hosting the rest of the website. While some server files are hashed, making their access obscure, the files corresponding to the file system router (those in `src/pages`) are predictably named. For example. the sourcemap file for `src/pages/index.astro` gets named `dist/client/pages/index.astro.mjs.map`. This vulnerability is the root cause of issue #12703, which links to a simple stackblitz project demonstrating the vulnerability. Upon build, notice the contents of the `dist/client` (referred to as `config.build.client` in astro code) folder. All astro servers make the folder in question accessible to the public internet without any authentication. It contains `.map` files corresponding to the code that runs on the server. All **server-output** projects on Astro 5 versions **v5.0.3** through **v5.0.7**, that have **sourcemaps enabled**, either directly or through an add-on such as `sentry`, are affected. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**. Additionally, all **static-output** projects built using Astro 4 versions **4.16.17 or older**, or Astro 5 versions **5.0.8 or older**, that have **sourcemaps enabled** are also affected. The fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9**, and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. The immediate impact is limited to source code. Any secrets or environment variables are not exposed unless they are present verbatim in the source code. There is no immediate loss of integrity within the the vulnerable server. However, it is possible to subsequently discover another vulnerability via the revealed source code . There is no immediate impact to availability of the vulnerable server. However, the presence of an unsafe regular expression, for example, can quickly be exploited to subsequently compromise the availability.

In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, as in most configurations a user who can log into the GoCD UI as an admin also has host administration permissions for the host/container that GoCD runs on, in order to manage artifact storage and other service-level configuration options. Additionally, since a GoCD admin has ability to configure and schedule pipelines tasks on all GoCD agents available to the server, the fundamental functionality of GoCD allows co-ordinated task execution similar to that of post-backup-scripts. However in restricted environments where the host administration is separated from the role of a GoCD admin, this may be unexpected. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0.

An **Improper URL Handling Vulnerability** allows an attacker to access sensitive local files on the server by exploiting the `file:///` protocol. This vulnerability is triggered via the **""real-browser""** request type, which takes a screenshot of the URL provided by the attacker. By supplying local file paths, such as `file:///etc/passwd`, an attacker can read sensitive data from the server. This vulnerability arises because the system does not properly validate or sanitize the user input for the URL field. Specifically: 1. The URL input (`<input data-v-5f5c86d7="""" id=""url"" type=""url"" class=""form-control"" pattern=""https?://.+"" required="""">`) allows users to input arbitrary file paths, including those using the `file:///` protocol, without server-side validation. 2. The server then uses the user-provided URL to make a request, passing it to a browser instance that performs the ""real-browser"" request, which takes a screenshot of the content at the given URL. If a local file path is entered (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`), the browser fetches and captures the file’s content. Since the user input is not validated, an attacker can manipulate the URL to request local files (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`), and the system will capture a screenshot of the file's content, potentially exposing sensitive data. Any **authenticated user** who can submit a URL in ""real-browser"" mode is at risk of exposing sensitive data through screenshots of these files.

Starting in version 13.0.0 and prior to versions 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2, Next.js is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution. This vulnerability can also be used as a Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack when deployed in providers billing by response times. (Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.). Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing. This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel. This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions. The issue was resolved in Next.js 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.

In affected versions an attacker is capable of updating or deleting groups from an organization given a few conditions: 1. The attacker has a user account in the server. 2. The attacker's account has admin or owner permissions in an unrelated organization. 3. The attacker knows the target organization's UUID and the target group's UUID. Note that this vulnerability is related to group functionality and as such is only applicable for servers who have enabled the `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED` setting, which is disabled by default. This attack can lead to different situations: 1. Denial of service, the attacker can limit users from accessing the organization's data by removing their membership from the group. 2. Privilege escalation, if the attacker is part of the victim organization, they can escalate their own privileges by joining a group they wouldn't normally have access to. For attackers that aren't part of the organization, this shouldn't lead to any possible plain-text data exfiltration as all the data is encrypted client side. This vulnerability is patched in Vaultwarden `1.32.7`, and users are recommended to update as soon as possible. If it's not possible to update to `1.32.7`, some possible workarounds are: 1. Disabling `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED`, which would disable groups functionality on the server. 2. Disabling `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`, which would not allow an attacker to create new accounts on the server.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-269""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-284""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-285""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-287""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:dani-garcia:vaultwarden:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.32.7"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3FB400CF-9812-4941-B31C-3518A966E5C1""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/security/advisories/GHSA-g65h-982x-4m5m"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"",""baseScore"":7.6,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""LOW"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""LOW""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":4.7},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.6,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

In 1.0, there is a vulnerability in the web application's handling of user-supplied input that is incorporated into a Jinja2 template. Specifically, when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, an attacker can inject Jinja2 syntax into the template, causing the server to execute arbitrary code. For example, an attacker might be able to inject expressions like {{ config }}, {{ self.class.mro[1].subclasses() }}, or more dangerous payloads that trigger execution of arbitrary Python code. The vulnerability can be reproduced by submitting crafted input to all the template fields handled by ckeditor, that are passed directly to a Jinja2 template.

If SVG or JPEGXL thumbnailers are enabled (they are disabled by default), a user may upload a file which claims to be either of these types and request a thumbnail to invoke a different decoder in ImageMagick. In some ImageMagick installations, this includes the capability to run Ghostscript to decode the image/file. If MP4 thumbnailers are enabled (also disabled by default), the same issue as above may occur with the ffmpeg installation instead. MMR uses a number of other decoders for all other file types when preparing thumbnails. Theoretical issues are possible with these decoders, however in testing they were not possible to exploit. This is fixed in MMR v1.3.8. MMR now inspects the mimetype of media prior to thumbnailing, and picks a thumbnailer based on those results instead of relying on user-supplied values. This may lead to fewer thumbnails when obscure file shapes are used. This also helps narrow scope of theoretical issues with all decoders MMR uses for thumbnails. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the SVG, JPEGXL, and MP4 thumbnail types in the MMR config which prevents the decoders from being invoked. Further disabling uncommon file types on the server is recommended to limit risk surface. Containers and other similar technologies may also be used to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in external decoders, like ImageMagick and ffmpeg. Some installations of ImageMagick may disable ""unsafe"" file types, like PDFs, already. This option can be replicated to other environments as needed. ffmpeg may be compiled with limited decoders/codecs. The Docker image for MMR disables PDFs and similar formats by default.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-502""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:t2bot:matrix-media-repo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.3.8"",""matchCriteriaId"":""9B68F8B2-5C9C-425E-8B26-582B49848883""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.3.8"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Release Notes""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/security/advisories/GHSA-rcxc-wjgw-579r"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory"",""Mitigation""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.8,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.3,""impactScore"":4.0},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,

And the issue seems to be that the corresponding devres group is not allocated. Normally, devres_open_group() is called from __hid_device_probe() but Hyper-V HID driver overrides 'hid_dev->driver' with 'mousevsc_hid_driver' stub and basically re-implements __hid_device_probe() by calling hid_parse() and hid_hw_start() but not devres_open_group(). hid_device_probe() does not call __hid_device_probe() for it. Later, when the driver is removed, hid_device_remove() calls devres_release_group() as it doesn't check whether hdev->driver was initially overridden or not. The issue seems to be related to the commit 62c68e7cee33 (""HID: ensure timely release of driver-allocated resources"") but the commit itself seems to be correct.

One of these cases is a loop device by using ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE. While this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of hfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write out-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the latter function reads a different io_size. Using a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the purposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size. We still use the max between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not initialized. Tested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024 and 4096.

The user then closes the queue. However the close will also forcefully signal the suspend fence after killing the queue, later when the G2H response for disable_scheduling comes back we have now cleared suspend_pending when signalling the suspend fence, so the disable_scheduling now incorrectly tries to also deregister the queue. This leads to warnings since the queue has yet to even be marked for destruction. We also seem to trigger errors later with trying to double unregister the same queue. To fix this tweak the ordering when handling the response to ensure we don't race with a disable_scheduling that didn't actually intend to perform an unregister. The destruction path should now also correctly wait for any pending_disable before marking as destroyed.

If allocated object failed in alloc_consistency_checks, all objects of the slab will be marked as used, and then the slab will be removed from the partial list. When an object belonging to the slab got freed later, the remove_full() function is called. Because the slab is neither on the partial list nor on the full list, it eventually lead to a list corruption (actually a list poison being detected). So we need to mark and isolate the slab page with metadata corruption, do not put it back in circulation. Because the debug caches avoid all the fastpaths, reusing the frozen bit to mark slab page with metadata corruption seems to be fine.

Then in the error path of btrfs_ref_tree_mod() we call btrfs_free_ref_cache(), which iterates over all block entries and then calls free_block_entry() for each one, and there we will trigger a use-after-free when we are called against the block entry to which we added the freed ref entry to its rbtree, since the rbtree still points to the block entry, as we didn't remove it from the rbtree before freeing it in the error path at btrfs_ref_tree_mod(). Fix this by removing the new ref entry from the rbtree before freeing it.

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes idr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a similar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) is still a spinlock. Instead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map pointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion. Therefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these to-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map. There are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr: (1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) It invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of htab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(), because the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems. It may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release the newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer of the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and releasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old element, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old element as well. (2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) Its caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(), htab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(). For htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after htab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just like lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list and invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe to reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these elements have been removed from the hash llist. Because htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation, __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept it as ---truncated---",,,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10e8a2dec9ff1b81de8e892b0850924038adbc6d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a50b4aa3007e63a590d501341f304676ebc74b3b"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9e9ed90b10c82a4e9d4d70a2890f06bfcdd3b78"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,

The problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable, it is nents = max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) >> 4 + 1. Given the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small. Worst case, the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKB is added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad. At least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So, eventually the ""skb_queue_walk loop"" in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries. This makes sg_next return NULL and this causes the oops. The patch sets nents to max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) * 2 to be able handle the worst-case.

But if CONFIG_INIT_ON_FREE_DEFAULT_ON is set to yes, kernel panic will happen: Call trace: destroy_workqueue+0x1c/0x258 ath10k_sdio_remove+0x84/0x94 sdio_bus_remove+0x50/0x16c device_release_driver_internal+0x188/0x25c device_driver_detach+0x20/0x2c This is because during 'rmmod ath10k', ath10k_sdio_remove() will call ath10k_core_destroy() before destroy_workqueue(). wiphy_dev_release() will finally be called in ath10k_core_destroy(). This function will free struct cfg80211_registered_device *rdev and all its members, including wiphy, dev and the pointer of sdio workqueue. Then the pointer of sdio workqueue will be set to NULL due to CONFIG_INIT_ON_FREE_DEFAULT_ON. After device release, destroy_workqueue() will use NULL pointer then the kernel panic happen. Call trace: ath10k_sdio_remove ->ath10k_core_unregister …… ->ath10k_core_stop ->ath10k_hif_stop ->ath10k_sdio_irq_disable ->ath10k_hif_power_down ->del_timer_sync(&ar_sdio->sleep_timer) ->ath10k_core_destroy ->ath10k_mac_destroy ->ieee80211_free_hw ->wiphy_free …… ->wiphy_dev_release ->destroy_workqueue Need to call destroy_workqueue() before ath10k_core_destroy(), free the work queue buffer first and then free pointer of work queue by ath10k_core_destroy(). This order matches the error path order in ath10k_sdio_probe(). No work will be queued on sdio workqueue between it is destroyed and ath10k_core_destroy() is called. Based on the call_stack above, the reason is: Only ath10k_sdio_sleep_timer_handler(), ath10k_sdio_hif_tx_sg() and ath10k_sdio_irq_disable() will queue work on sdio workqueue. Sleep timer will be deleted before ath10k_core_destroy() in ath10k_hif_power_down(). ath10k_sdio_irq_disable() only be called in ath10k_hif_stop(). ath10k_core_unregister() will call ath10k_hif_power_down() to stop hif bus, so ath10k_sdio_hif_tx_sg() won't be called anymore.

This array has a fixed size and the index was not being checked against the array's bounds before accessing it. This fix adds a conditional check to ensure that the hpd_source index is within the valid range of the link_enc_hpd_regs array.

This issue can be consistently reproduced on three different servers: * a 448-core server * a 256-core server * a 192-core server [Root Cause] Since multiple threads are created by the hackbench program (along with the command argument 'thread'), a shared vma might be accessed by two or more cores simultaneously. When two or more cores observe that vma->numab_state is NULL at the same time, vma->numab_state will be overwritten. Although current code ensures that only one thread scans the VMAs in a single 'numa_scan_period', there might be a chance for another thread to enter in the next 'numa_scan_period' while we have not gotten till numab_state allocation [1]. Note that the command `/opt/ltp/testcases/bin/hackbench 50 process 1000` cannot the reproduce the issue. It is verified with 200+ test runs. [Solution] Use the cmpxchg atomic operation to ensure that only one thread executes the vma->numab_state assignment.

When map is released from system via dev_map_free(), we iterate through all of the entries and an iterator variable is also an int, which implies OOB accesses. Again, change it to be u32.

Commit 6539cffa9495 (""cacheinfo: Add arch specific early level initializer"") lets secondary CPUs correct (and reallocate memory) cacheinfo data if needed. If the early build functionality is not used and cacheinfo does not need correction, memory for cacheinfo is never allocated. x86 does not use the early build functionality. Consequently, during the cacheinfo CPU hotplug callback, last_level_cache_is_valid() attempts to dereference a NULL pointer: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000100 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not present page PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEPMT SMP NOPTI CPU: 0 PID 19 Comm: cpuhp/0 Not tainted 6.4.0-rc2 #1 RIP: 0010: last_level_cache_is_valid+0x95/0xe0a Allocate memory for cacheinfo during the cacheinfo CPU hotplug callback if not done earlier. Moreover, before determining the validity of the last-level cache info, ensure that it has been allocated. Simply checking for non-zero cache_leaves() is not sufficient, as some architectures (e.g., Intel processors) have non-zero cache_leaves() before allocation. Dereferencing NULL cacheinfo can occur in update_per_cpu_data_slice_size(). This function iterates over all online CPUs. However, a CPU may have come online recently, but its cacheinfo may not have been allocated yet. While here, remove an unnecessary indentation in allocate_cache_info().

This is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry() and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a page from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which the i_size value is assigned. This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access that exceeds the folio/page size. Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit loss from ""unsigned int"" to ""u64"". The return value of nilfs_last_byte() is also of type ""unsigned int"", but it is truncated so as not to exceed PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required.","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.6.30"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.4.287"",""matchCriteriaId"":""2D46A016-4FC6-416B-92D5-0A3833B3F57C""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.5"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.10.231"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B5C644CC-2BD7-4E32-BC54-8DCC7ABE9935""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.11"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.15.174"",""matchCriteriaId"":""419FD073-1517-4FD5-8158-F94BC68A1E89""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.16"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.1.120"",""matchCriteriaId"":""09AC6122-E2A4-40FE-9D33-268A1B2EC265""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.2"",""versionEndIncluding"":""6.6.66"",""matchCriteriaId"":""531ECA60-482F-48A9-924B-24405022FB0C""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.7"",""versionEndIncluding"":""6.12.5"",""matchCriteriaId"":""33EC61E4-C15F-402A-A415-5745882E16D2""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""62567B3C-6CEE-46D0-BC2E-B3717FBF7D13""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09d6d05579fd46e61abf6e457bb100ff11f3a9d3"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31f7b57a77d4c82a34ddcb6ff35b5aa577ef153e"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/48eb6e7404948032bbe811c5affbe39f6b316951"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5af8366625182f01f6d8465c9a3210574673af57"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/985ebec4ab0a28bb5910c3b1481a40fbf7f9e61d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3afea07477baccdbdec4483f8d5e59d42a3f67f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3732102a9d638d8627d14fdf7b208462f0520e0"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

The kref_put() call may decrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup through sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work via sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp. After kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may reference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed, this results in a slab-use-after-free error. Move the kref_put(&sfp->f_ref, sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the open_rel_lock mutex. This ensures: - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is decremented. - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the mutex handling in sg_release(). The fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the bug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper sequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations, eliminating the risk of use-after-free errors in sg_release().","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""}]},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""3.16.85"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.6.66"",""matchCriteriaId"":""01F1098C-DC37-41C5-B4D0-1D3B0B04ED49""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.7"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.5"",""matchCriteriaId"":""9501D045-7A94-42CA-8B03-821BE94A65B7""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""62567B3C-6CEE-46D0-BC2E-B3717FBF7D13""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/198b89dd5a595ee3f96e5ce5c448b0484cd0e53c"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f5e2f1ca5875728fcf62bc1a054707444ab4960"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/275b8347e21ab8193e93223a8394a806e4ba8918"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/285ce1f89f8d414e7eecab5ef5118cd512596318"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/59b30afa578637169e2819536bb66459fdddc39d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e19acb1926c4a1f30ee1ec84d8afba2d975bd534"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f10593ad9bc36921f623361c9e3dd96bd52d85ee"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

CVE-2024-56644,416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67,2024-12-27T15:15:24.163,2024-12-27T15:15:24.163,Awaiting Analysis,[],"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net/ipv6: release expired exception dst cached in socket Dst objects get leaked in ip6_negative_advice() when this function is executed for an expired IPv6 route located in the exception table. There are several conditions that must be fulfilled for the leak to occur: * an ICMPv6 packet indicating a change of the MTU for the path is received, resulting in an exception dst being created * a TCP connection that uses the exception dst for routing packets must start timing out so that TCP begins retransmissions * after the exception dst expires, the FIB6 garbage collector must not run before TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for the expired exception dst When TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for an exception dst that has expired and if no other socket holds a reference to the exception dst, the refcount of the exception dst is 2, which corresponds to the increment made by dst_init() and the increment made by the TCP socket for which the connection is timing out. The refcount made by the socket is never released. The refcount of the dst is decremented in sk_dst_reset() but that decrement is counteracted by a dst_hold() intentionally placed just before the sk_dst_reset() in ip6_negative_advice(). After ip6_negative_advice() has finished, there is no other object tied to the dst. The socket lost its reference stored in sk_dst_cache and the dst is no longer in the exception table. The exception dst becomes a leaked object. As a result of this dst leak, an unbalanced refcount is reported for the loopback device of a net namespace being destroyed under kernels that do not contain e5f80fcf869a (""ipv6: give an IPv6 dev to blackhole_netdev""): unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2 Fix the dst leak by removing the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice(). The patch that introduced the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice() was 92f1655aa2b22 (""net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race""). But 92f1655aa2b22 merely refactored the code with regards to the dst refcount so the issue was present even before 92f1655aa2b22. The bug was introduced in 54c1a859efd9f (""ipv6: Don't drop cache route entry unless timer actually expired."") where the expired cached route is deleted and the sk_dst_cache member of the socket is set to NULL by calling dst_negative_advice() but the refcount belonging to the socket is left unbalanced. The IPv4 version - ipv4_negative_advice() - is not affected by this bug. When the TCP connection times out ipv4_negative_advice() merely resets the sk_dst_cache of the socket while decrementing the refcount of the exception dst.",,,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b8903e6c881f72c6849d4952de742c656eb5ab9"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3301ab7d5aeb0fe270f73a3d4810c9d1b6a9f045"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/535add1e9f274502209cb997801208bbe1ae6c6f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b591bd522b71c42a82898290e35d32b482047e4"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a95808252e8acc0123bacd2dff8b9af10bc145b7"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b90d061345bb8cd51fece561a800bae1c95448a6"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f43d12fd0fa8ee5b9caf8a3927e10d06431764d2"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,

This can lead to out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not have sufficient space. To address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that buf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg) before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of call_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-125""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.14.176"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.15"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B6274D15-ED31-472F-B0FC-C76687469C95""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""4.19.31"",""versionEndExcluding"":""4.20"",""matchCriteriaId"":""C208F54A-1F85-44EF-9E91-6DA461A49CA0""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.0.4"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.10.232"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3B31FA24-D2AC-48A5-A29D-35820E219F8E""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.11"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.15.175"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7A1F3620-6900-4852-9229-C3527377EBDA""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.16"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.1.121"",""matchCriteriaId"":""D8DA16A0-9C6E-493E-90EE-309A34901477""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.2"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.6.67"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BF4F2CD1-2CA6-4D6B-9B0C-57C3C4D6544A""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.7"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.6"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0CB1A9BB-F95E-43DD-A2FD-147912FD91E5""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""62567B3C-6CEE-46D0-BC2E-B3717FBF7D13""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""5A073481-106D-4B15-B4C7-FB0213B8E1D4""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/143f723e9eb4f0302ffb7adfdc7ef77eab3f68e0"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/212846fafb753a48e869e2a342fc1e24048da771"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/265e98f72bac6c41a4492d3e30a8e5fd22fe0779"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/616aa5f3c86e0479bcbb81e41c08c43ff32af637"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bbdb3307f609ec4dc9558770f464ede01fe52aed"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e08dc2dc3c3f7938df0e4476fe3e6fdec5583c1d"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":6.0,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":0.8,""impactScore"":5.2}]",,,,,,,

In such cases, the kernel may crash with kernel messages like: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000014 PGD 19036a067 P4D 1940a3067 PUD 136c9b067 PMD 0 Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI CPU: 74 UID: 0 PID: 3183 Comm: testCli Not tainted 6.11.9 #2 RIP: 0010:cache_tag_flush_range+0x9b/0x250 Call Trace: <TASK> ? __die+0x1f/0x60 ? page_fault_oops+0x163/0x590 ? exc_page_fault+0x72/0x190 ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30 ? cache_tag_flush_range+0x9b/0x250 ? cache_tag_flush_range+0x5d/0x250 intel_iommu_tlb_sync+0x29/0x40 intel_iommu_unmap_pages+0xfe/0x160 __iommu_unmap+0xd8/0x1a0 vfio_unmap_unpin+0x182/0x340 [vfio_iommu_type1] vfio_remove_dma+0x2a/0xb0 [vfio_iommu_type1] vfio_iommu_type1_ioctl+0xafa/0x18e0 [vfio_iommu_type1] Move cache_tag_unassign_domain() before iommu_disable_pci_caps() to fix it.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-401""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-476""}]},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.10"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.6"",""matchCriteriaId"":""EFB33A9C-69D1-4691-B0BD-2D5C9590E239""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""62567B3C-6CEE-46D0-BC2E-B3717FBF7D13""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""5A073481-106D-4B15-B4C7-FB0213B8E1D4""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f2557e08a617a4b5e92a48a1a9a6f86621def18"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a0a72d3ed919ebe6491f527630998be053151d8"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

However, the pmd allocation is not using the generic mechanism used by the VMA code (e.g. pmd_alloc()), or the RISC-V specific create_pgd_mapping()/alloc_pmd_late(). Instead, the vmemmap page table code allocates a page, and calls vmemmap_set_pmd(). This results in that the pmd ctor is *not* called, nor would it make sense to do so. Now, when tearing down a vmemmap page table pmd, the cleanup code would unconditionally, and incorrectly call the pmd dtor, which results in a crash (best case).

CVE-2024-56674,416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67,2024-12-27T15:15:27.313,2025-01-06T15:06:43.330,Analyzed,[],"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: virtio_net: correct netdev_tx_reset_queue() invocation point When virtnet_close is followed by virtnet_open, some TX completions can possibly remain unconsumed, until they are finally processed during the first NAPI poll after the netdev_tx_reset_queue(), resulting in a crash [1]. Commit b96ed2c97c79 (""virtio_net: move netdev_tx_reset_queue() call before RX napi enable"") was not sufficient to eliminate all BQL crash cases for virtio-net. This issue can be reproduced with the latest net-next master by running: `while :; do ip l set DEV down; ip l set DEV up; done` under heavy network TX load from inside the machine. netdev_tx_reset_queue() can actually be dropped from virtnet_open path; the device is not stopped in any case. For BQL core part, it's just like traffic nearly ceases to exist for some period. For stall detector added to BQL, even if virtnet_close could somehow lead to some TX completions delayed for long, followed by virtnet_open, we can just take it as stall as mentioned in commit 6025b9135f7a (""net: dqs: add NIC stall detector based on BQL""). Note also that users can still reset stall_max via sysfs. So, drop netdev_tx_reset_queue() from virtnet_enable_queue_pair(). This eliminates the BQL crashes. As a result, netdev_tx_reset_queue() is now explicitly required in freeze/restore path. This patch adds it to immediately after free_unused_bufs(), following the rule of thumb: netdev_tx_reset_queue() should follow any SKB freeing not followed by netdev_tx_completed_queue(). This seems the most consistent and streamlined approach, and now netdev_tx_reset_queue() runs whenever free_unused_bufs() is done.

Since the sound card driver's probe happens before the card registration, accessing any of the members of a dummy component during probe will result in undefined behavior. This can be observed in the mt8188 and mt8195 machine sound drivers. By omitting a dai link subnode in the sound card's node in the Devicetree, the default uninitialized dummy codec is used, and when its dai_name pointer gets passed to strcmp() it results in a null pointer dereference and a kernel panic. In addition to that, set_card_codec_info() in the generic helpers file, mtk-soundcard-driver.c, will populate a dai link with a dummy codec when a dai link node is present in DT but with no codec property. The result is that at probe time, a dummy codec can either be uninitialized with num_codecs = 0, or be an initialized dummy codec, with num_codecs = 1 and dai_name = ""snd-soc-dummy-dai"". In order to accommodate for both situations, check that num_codecs is not zero before accessing the codecs' fields but still check for the codec's dai name against ""snd-soc-dummy-dai"" as needed.

CVE-2024-56687,416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67,2024-12-28T10:15:12.153,2025-01-31T15:58:17.773,Analyzed,[],"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb: musb: Fix hardware lockup on first Rx endpoint request There is a possibility that a request's callback could be invoked from usb_ep_queue() (call trace below, supplemented with missing calls): req->complete from usb_gadget_giveback_request (drivers/usb/gadget/udc/core.c:999) usb_gadget_giveback_request from musb_g_giveback (drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:147) musb_g_giveback from rxstate (drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:784) rxstate from musb_ep_restart (drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:1169) musb_ep_restart from musb_ep_restart_resume_work (drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:1176) musb_ep_restart_resume_work from musb_queue_resume_work (drivers/usb/musb/musb_core.c:2279) musb_queue_resume_work from musb_gadget_queue (drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:1241) musb_gadget_queue from usb_ep_queue (drivers/usb/gadget/udc/core.c:300) According to the docstring of usb_ep_queue(), this should not happen: ""Note that @req's ->complete() callback must never be called from within usb_ep_queue() as that can create deadlock situations."" In fact, a hardware lockup might occur in the following sequence: 1. The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable(). 2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an interrupt. 3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag remains set. 4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call of req->complete(), as shown in the call trace above. 5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3) repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the request before invoking the callback. 6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains set. For this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at some point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet gadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the task context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are re-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The gadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but the first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up, triggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet arrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from receiving any further packets from the USB host. The situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This particular issue can be resolved in several possible ways: 1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver. Similar ""bugs"" could be hidden in other drivers as well. 2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(), for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an inelegant hack. 3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is not ready to process them. 4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart(). This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at least one request in the queue.

However, in certain cases, a raw tracepoint argument may end up being NULL. More context about this issue is available in [0]. Thus, there is a discrepancy between the reality, that raw_tp arguments can actually be NULL, and the verifier's knowledge, that they are never NULL, causing explicit NULL checks to be deleted, and accesses to such pointers potentially crashing the kernel. To fix this, mark raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL, and then special case the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow passing them into helpers/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp programs only. Ensure that we don't do this when ref_obj_id > 0, as in that case this is an acquired object and doesn't need such adjustment. The reason we do mask_raw_tp_trusted_reg logic is because other will recheck in places whether the register is a trusted_reg, and then consider our register as untrusted when detecting the presence of the PTR_MAYBE_NULL flag. To allow safe dereference, we enable PROBE_MEM marking when we see loads into trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL. While trusted raw_tp arguments can also be passed into helpers or kfuncs where such broken assumption may cause issues, a future patch set will tackle their case separately, as PTR_TO_BTF_ID (without PTR_TRUSTED) can already be passed into helpers and causes similar problems. Thus, they are left alone for now. It is possible that these checks also permit passing non-raw_tp args that are trusted PTR_TO_BTF_ID with null marking. In such a case, allowing dereference when pointer is NULL expands allowed behavior, so won't regress existing programs, and the case of passing these into helpers is the same as above and will be dealt with later. Also update the failure case in tp_btf_nullable selftest to capture the new behavior, as the verifier will no longer cause an error when directly dereference a raw tracepoint argument marked as __nullable.

Using the `bird` service, these routers continuously update BGP-advertised routes due to frequently changing nexthop destinations, while also managing significant IPv6 traffic. The lockups occur during the traversal of the multipath circular linked-list in the `fib6_select_path` function, particularly while iterating through the siblings in the list. The issue typically arises when the nodes of the linked list are unexpectedly deleted concurrently on a different core—indicated by their 'next' and 'previous' elements pointing back to the node itself and their reference count dropping to zero. This results in an infinite loop, leading to a soft lockup that triggers a system panic via the watchdog timer. Apply RCU primitives in the problematic code sections to resolve the issue. Where necessary, update the references to fib6_siblings to annotate or use the RCU APIs. Include a test script that reproduces the issue. The script periodically updates the routing table while generating a heavy load of outgoing IPv6 traffic through multiple iperf3 clients. It consistently induces infinite soft lockups within a couple of minutes.

A vulnerability has been reported in versions 1.50.3 and prior where an attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing session hijacking. Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the user's session until the token expires or is manually cleared. This vulnerability hinges on the attacker's ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like XSS, or via direct access to the victim's device. Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability, it is recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to best mitigate risk. If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over SSL connections to encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit.

This is because in some paths that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block() drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption, the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block() and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block() is called, resulting in a use-after-free. Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed. This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""}]},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-416""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.8"",""matchCriteriaId"":""37A8903F-DC48-45AD-98DC-188AFD7C5844""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""62567B3C-6CEE-46D0-BC2E-B3717FBF7D13""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""5A073481-106D-4B15-B4C7-FB0213B8E1D4""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DE491969-75AE-4A6B-9A58-8FC5AF98798F""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""93C0660D-7FB8-4FBA-892A-B064BA71E49E""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/44f52bbe96dfdbe4aca3818a2534520082a07040"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/526ff5b27f090fb15040471f892cd2c9899ce314"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66376f1a73cba57fd0af2631d7888605b738e499"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a466b8693b9add05de99af00c7bdff8259ecf19"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba5120a2fb5f23b4d39d302e181aa5d4e28a90d1"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3a403d8ce36f5a809a492581de5ad17843e4701"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,

When the decoder finds an inappropriate instruction while WFE is set ENDBR, the CPU raises a #CP fault. For the ""kernel IBT no ENDBR"" selftest where #CPs are deliberately triggered, the WFE state of the interrupted context needs to be cleared to let execution continue. Otherwise when the CPU resumes from the instruction that just caused the previous #CP, another missing-ENDBRANCH #CP is raised and the CPU enters a dead loop. This is not a problem with IDT because it doesn't preserve WFE and IRET doesn't set WFE. But FRED provides space on the entry stack (in an expanded CS area) to save and restore the WFE state, thus the WFE state is no longer clobbered, so software must clear it. Clear WFE to avoid dead looping in ibt_clear_fred_wfe() and the !ibt_fatal code path when execution is allowed to continue. Clobbering WFE in any other circumstance is a security-relevant bug.

CVE-2024-56770,416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67,2025-01-08T17:15:15.957,2025-01-10T17:32:12.967,Analyzed,[],"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc In general, 'qlen' of any classful qdisc should keep track of the number of packets that the qdisc itself and all of its children holds. In case of netem, 'qlen' only accounts for the packets in its internal tfifo. When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use 'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created or dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics of netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc. 'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo. If a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent about this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the newly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated. If 'qlen' reaches the configured sch->limit, the enqueue function stops working, even though the tfifo is not full. Reproduce the bug: Ensure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root qdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine as follows: $ tc qdisc add dev <oif> root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100 $ tc qdisc add dev <oif> parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms Send bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3 client on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics: $ tc -s qdisc show dev <oif> Statistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that netem's backlog > limit, netem stopped accepting packets): qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0) backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0 qdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0) backlog 0b 0p requeues 0 Statistics after the fix: qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0) backlog 0b 0p requeues 0 qdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0) backlog 0b 0p requeues 0 tbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'. The interface fully stops transferring packets and ""locks"". In this case, the child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at its limit and no more packets are accepted. This patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is only decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not during enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus accounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As in other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of how many packets are held in netem and all of its children. As before, sch->limit remains as the maximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's backlog statistics.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-noinfo""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""3.3"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.4.288"",""matchCriteriaId"":""2BBFF06A-6037-47B4-A3CF-B6B0F51D3491""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.5"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.10.232"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0B975945-2894-4433-BA59-0988B75B4C12""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.11"",""versionEndExcluding"":""5.15.175"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7A1F3620-6900-4852-9229-C3527377EBDA""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""5.16"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.1.121"",""matchCriteriaId"":""D8DA16A0-9C6E-493E-90EE-309A34901477""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.2"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.6.67"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BF4F2CD1-2CA6-4D6B-9B0C-57C3C4D6544A""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""6.7"",""versionEndExcluding"":""6.12.6"",""matchCriteriaId"":""0CB1A9BB-F95E-43DD-A2FD-147912FD91E5""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""62567B3C-6CEE-46D0-BC2E-B3717FBF7D13""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.13:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""5A073481-106D-4B15-B4C7-FB0213B8E1D4""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10df49cfca73dfbbdb6c4150d859f7e8926ae427"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/216509dda290f6db92c816dd54b83c1df9da9e76"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/356078a5c55ec8d2061fcc009fb8599f5b0527f9"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3824c5fad18eeb7abe0c4fc966f29959552dca3e"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/83c6ab12f08dcc09d4c5ac86fdb89736b28f1d31"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c2047b0e216c8edce227d7c42f99ac2877dad0e4"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f8d4bc455047cf3903cd6f85f49978987dbb3027"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"",""tags"":[""Patch""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":5.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""LOCAL"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.8,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,

This was not detected during regular testing without driver_async_probe. Convert the SoC code to platform driver and instantiate a platform device in its current device_initcall() to probe the platform driver.

SPI thread prepares the tx data chunks from the tx skb pointed by the ongoing_tx_skb pointer. When the tx skb pointed by the ongoing_tx_skb is processed, the tx skb pointed by the waiting_tx_skb is assigned to ongoing_tx_skb and the waiting_tx_skb pointer is assigned with NULL. Whenever there is a new tx skb from n/w stack, it will be assigned to waiting_tx_skb pointer if it is NULL. Enqueuing and processing of a tx skb handled in two different threads. Consider a scenario where the SPI thread processed an ongoing_tx_skb and it moves next tx skb from waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer without doing any NULL check. At this time, if the waiting_tx_skb pointer is NULL then ongoing_tx_skb pointer is also assigned with NULL. After that, if a new tx skb is assigned to waiting_tx_skb pointer by the n/w stack and there is a chance to overwrite the tx skb pointer with NULL in the SPI thread. Finally one of the tx skb will be left as unhandled, resulting packet missing and memory leak. - Consider the below scenario where the TXC reported from the previous transfer is 10 and ongoing_tx_skb holds an tx ethernet frame which can be transported in 20 TXCs and waiting_tx_skb is still NULL. tx_credits = 10; /* 21 are filled in the previous transfer */ ongoing_tx_skb = 20; waiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */ - So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true. - After oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs() ongoing_tx_skb = 10; waiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */ - Perform SPI transfer. - Process SPI rx buffer to get the TXC from footers. - Now let's assume previously filled 21 TXCs are freed so we are good to transport the next remaining 10 tx chunks from ongoing_tx_skb. tx_credits = 21; ongoing_tx_skb = 10; waiting_tx_skb = NULL; - So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true again. - In the oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs() ongoing_tx_skb = NULL; waiting_tx_skb = NULL; - Now the below bad case might happen, Thread1 (oa_tc6_start_xmit) Thread2 (oa_tc6_spi_thread_handler) --------------------------- ----------------------------------- - if waiting_tx_skb is NULL - if ongoing_tx_skb is NULL - ongoing_tx_skb = waiting_tx_skb - waiting_tx_skb = skb - waiting_tx_skb = NULL ... - ongoing_tx_skb = NULL - if waiting_tx_skb is NULL - waiting_tx_skb = skb To overcome the above issue, protect the moving of tx skb reference from waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer and assigning new tx skb to waiting_tx_skb pointer, so that the other thread can't access the waiting_tx_skb pointer until the current thread completes moving the tx skb reference safely.",,,"[{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f2eb6c32bae04b375bb7a0aedbeefb6dbbcb775"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""},{""url"":""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e592b5110b3e9393881b0a019d86832bbf71a47f"",""source"":""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",,,,,,,,

Based on the code analysis, it was determined that the /api/member/avatar API endpoint receives a base64 string as input. This string is then passed to the memberService.uploadAvatarByBase64 method for processing. Within the service, the base64-encoded image is parsed. For example, given a string like: data:image/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPjwvaHRtbD4= the content after the comma is extracted and decoded using Base64.getDecoder().decode(). The substring from the 11th character up to the first occurrence of a semicolon (;) is assigned to the suffix variable (representing the file extension). The decoded content is then written to a file. However, the file extension is not validated, and since this functionality is exposed to the frontend, it poses significant security risks.","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-434""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:1000mz:chestnutcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""1.5.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""6C940588-5078-47B2-8458-C36094B16EF6""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://gitee.com/liweiyi/ChestnutCMS"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Product""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/Zerone0x00/CVE/blob/main/ChestnutCMS/CVE-2024-56828.md"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://www.1000mz.com/"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Product""]}]","[{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,
