ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in request URLs before it separates the URL path component from the optional query string component. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC compliant back-end applications. The vulnerability hides an attack payload in the path component of the URL from WAF rules inspecting it. A back-end may be vulnerable if it uses the path component of request URLs to construct queries. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.0.12.

Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see RFC 9000 Section 5.1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem.

This can be exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds the web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary code.","[{""source"":""ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-306""}]}]",,"[{""url"":""https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-107-02"",""source"":""ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov""},{""url"":""https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-107-02"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108""}]","[{""source"":""ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]","[{""source"":""ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""4.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"",""baseScore"":8.7,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""attackRequirements"":""NONE"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""vulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""vulnIntegrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""vulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""subConfidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""subIntegrityImpact"":""NONE"",""subAvailabilityImpact"":""NONE"",""exploitMaturity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""confidentialityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""integrityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""availabilityRequirement"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackVector"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackComplexity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedAttackRequirements"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedPrivilegesRequired"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedUserInteraction"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubIntegrityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Safety"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Automatable"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""Recovery"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""valueDensity"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""vulnerabilityResponseEffort"":""NOT_DEFINED"",""providerUrgency"":""NOT_DEFINED""}}]",,,,,,

This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. At HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak.","[{""source"":""secalert@redhat.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-400""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:linux:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F3E0B672-3E06-4422-B2A4-0BD073AEC2A1""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:vmware_vsphere:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3A756737-1CC4-42C2-A4DF-E1C893B4E2D5""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B55E8D50-99B4-47EC-86F9-699B67D473CE""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:netapp:oncommand_workflow_automation:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""5735E553-9731-4AAC-BCFF-989377F817B3""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:fuse:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""077732DB-F5F3-4E9C-9AC0-8142AB85B32F""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:integration_camel_for_spring_boot:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""78698F40-0777-4990-822D-02E1B5D0E2C0""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_application_platform:7.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""645A908C-18C2-4AB1-ACE7-3969E3A552A5""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:4.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""EA983F8C-3A06-450A-AEFF-9429DE9A3454""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:4.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""40449571-22F8-44FA-B57B-B43F71AB25E2""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform_for_linuxone:4.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""B02036DD-4489-480B-B7D4-4EB08952377B""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform_for_linuxone:4.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""C7E78C55-45B6-4E01-9773-D3468F8EA9C3""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform_for_power:4.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""30E2CF79-2D56-48AB-952E-5DDAFE471073""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform_for_power:4.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""54E24055-813B-4E6D-94B7-FAD5F78B8537""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:single_sign-on:-:*:*:*:text-only:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""341E6313-20D5-44CB-9719-B20585DC5AD6""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:redhat:single_sign-on:7.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""2DEC61BC-E699-456E-99B6-C049F2A5F23F""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1674"",""source"":""secalert@redhat.com"",""tags"":[""Third

The issue arises from the application's method of validating shell commands against an allowlist or denylist, where it only checks the first word of the command. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions by crafting commands that are executed despite not being on the allowlist or by including malicious commands not present in the denylist. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands.","[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-78""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:agpt:autogpt_classic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""0.5.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""0.5.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""9A52AEC2-A059-4CA5-A8D8-D5DE045D3612""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/26324f29849967fa72c207da929af612f1740669"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/416c4a8b-36ba-4bbc-850a-a2f978b0fac8"",""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/26324f29849967fa72c207da929af612f1740669"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://huntr.com/bounties/416c4a8b-36ba-4bbc-850a-a2f978b0fac8"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,"[{""source"":""security@huntr.dev"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.0"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]"

Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however, it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records.
