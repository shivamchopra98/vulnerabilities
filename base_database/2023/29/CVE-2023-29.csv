CVE-2023-29001,security-advisories@github.com,2024-11-27T19:15:31.497,2025-04-10T14:58:31.463,Analyzed,[],"Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations. The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address, an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip_ipv6_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls, which can cause a stack overflow. The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG, but is expected to be patched in the next release. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2264. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release.

The SvelteKit framework offers developers an option to create simple REST APIs. This is done by defining a `+server.js` file, containing endpoint handlers for different HTTP methods. SvelteKit provides out-of-the-box cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection to its users. While the implementation does a sufficient job in mitigating common CSRF attacks, prior to version 1.15.1, the protection can be bypassed by simply specifying a different `Content-Type` header value. If abused, this issue will allow malicious requests to be submitted from third-party domains, which can allow execution of operations within the context of the victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to unauthorized access to users’ accounts. SvelteKit 1.15.1 updates the `is_form_content_type` function call in the CSRF protection logic to include `text/plain`. As additional hardening of the CSRF protection mechanism against potential method overrides, SvelteKit 1.15.1 is now performing validation on `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` methods as well. This latter hardening is only needed to protect users who have put in some sort of `?_method= override` feature themselves in their `handle` hook, so that the request that resolve sees could be `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` when the browser issues a `POST` request.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-184""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-352""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-352""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:svelte:sveltekit:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.15.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""54383DF7-6A34-4582-8DE1-9E27DF1AE9E2""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/commit/bb2253d51d00aba2e4353952d4fb0dcde6c77123"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/releases/tag/%40sveltejs%2Fkit%401.15.1"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Release Notes""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/security/advisories/GHSA-5p75-vc5g-8rv2"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Mitigation"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/commit/bb2253d51d00aba2e4353952d4fb0dcde6c77123"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/releases/tag/%40sveltejs%2Fkit%401.15.1"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch"",""Release Notes""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/security/advisories/GHSA-5p75-vc5g-8rv2"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Mitigation"",""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,,

This bug can be used to inject arbitrary configuration into a user's `$GIT_DIR/config` when attempting to remove the configuration section associated with that submodule. When the attacker injects configuration values which specify executables to run (such as `core.pager`, `core.editor`, `core.sshCommand`, etc.) this can lead to a remote code execution. A fix A fix is available in versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1.

CVE-2023-29008,security-advisories@github.com,2023-04-06T17:15:10.547,2024-11-21T07:56:23.037,Modified,[],"The SvelteKit framework offers developers an option to create simple REST APIs. This is done by defining a `+server.js` file, containing endpoint handlers for different HTTP methods. SvelteKit provides out-of-the-box cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection to its users. The protection is implemented at `kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js`. While the implementation does a sufficient job of mitigating common CSRF attacks, the protection can be bypassed in versions prior to 1.15.2 by simply specifying an upper-cased `Content-Type` header value. The browser will not send uppercase characters, but this check does not block all expected CORS requests. If abused, this issue will allow malicious requests to be submitted from third-party domains, which can allow execution of operations within the context of the victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to unauthorized access to users’ accounts. This may lead to all POST operations requiring authentication being allowed in the following cases: If the target site sets `SameSite=None` on its auth cookie and the user visits a malicious site in a Chromium-based browser; if the target site doesn't set the `SameSite` attribute explicitly and the user visits a malicious site with Firefox/Safari with tracking protections turned off; and/or if the user is visiting a malicious site with a very outdated browser. SvelteKit 1.15.2 contains a patch for this issue. It is also recommended to explicitly set `SameSite` to a value other than `None` on authentication cookies especially if the upgrade cannot be done in a timely manner.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-918""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-352""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:svelte:sveltekit:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.15.2"",""matchCriteriaId"":""744553CC-471B-437B-B811-E5512A7E5C60""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/commit/ba436c6685e751d968a960fbda65f24cf7a82e9f"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/security/advisories/GHSA-gv7g-x59x-wf8f"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/commit/ba436c6685e751d968a960fbda65f24cf7a82e9f"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/security/advisories/GHSA-gv7g-x59x-wf8f"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,,

The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\etc\connectrc`.

Version 0.2.32 mitigates this issue by restricting the resources the `open-feature-operator-controller-manager` can modify.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-269""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""NVD-CWE-noinfo""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:openfeature:*:*:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""0.2.32"",""matchCriteriaId"":""9EDFB403-3FD6-4AE9-8F27-076A2AA98232""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/releases/tag/v0.2.32"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Release Notes""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-cwf6-xj49-wp83"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/releases/tag/v0.2.32"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-cwf6-xj49-wp83"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.0,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""HIGH"",""privilegesRequired"":""HIGH"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":1.3,""impactScore"":6.0},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,,

Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for user authentication, in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-384""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-384""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:fastify:passport:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.1.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3F071BA9-FBA0-4860-9B99-9D48230422D2""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:fastify:passport:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.3.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""341AD078-D84A-45B6-876F-7FA286EECAAA""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/43c82c321db58ea3e375dd475de60befbfcf2a11"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-4m3m-ppvx-xgw9"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/43c82c321db58ea3e375dd475de60befbfcf2a11"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-4m3m-ppvx-xgw9"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":8.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.2},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":8.1,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.2}]",,,,,,,,

The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library, when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions, can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication, preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently, CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session, fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing, and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport', 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default, preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-352""},{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-384""}]},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-352""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:fastify:passport:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.1.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3F071BA9-FBA0-4860-9B99-9D48230422D2""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:fastify:passport:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.3.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""341AD078-D84A-45B6-876F-7FA286EECAAA""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/07c90feab9cba0dd4779e47cfb0717a7e2f01d3d"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-2ccf-ffrj-m4qw"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]},{""url"":""https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/07c90feab9cba0dd4779e47cfb0717a7e2f01d3d"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-2ccf-ffrj-m4qw"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Technical Description""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":3.6},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":6.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""REQUIRED"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,,

Some connections use user-controlled endpoints, which could be malicious and attempt to keep the connection open for an extended period of time. As a result users were able to trigger large amount of egress network connections, possibly exhausting network pool resources and lock up legitimate requests. A new mechanism has been introduced to cancel external connections that might access user-controlled endpoints.

CVE-2023-29193,security-advisories@github.com,2023-04-14T20:15:09.670,2024-11-21T07:56:41.343,Modified,[],"SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. The `spicedb serve` command contains a flag named `--grpc-preshared-key` which is used to protect the gRPC API from being accessed by unauthorized requests. The values of this flag are to be considered sensitive, secret data. The `/debug/pprof/cmdline` endpoint served by the metrics service (defaulting running on port `9090`) reveals the command-line flags provided for debugging purposes. If a password is set via the `--grpc-preshared-key` then the key is revealed by this endpoint along with any other flags provided to the SpiceDB binary. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1. ### Impact All deployments abiding by the recommended best practices for production usage are **NOT affected**: - Authzed's SpiceDB Serverless - Authzed's SpiceDB Dedicated - SpiceDB Operator Users configuring SpiceDB via environment variables are **NOT affected**. Users **MAY be affected** if they expose their metrics port to an untrusted network and are configuring `--grpc-preshared-key` via command-line flag. ### Patches TODO ### Workarounds To workaround this issue you can do one of the following: - Configure the preshared key via an environment variable (e.g. `SPICEDB_GRPC_PRESHARED_KEY=yoursecret spicedb serve`) - Reconfigure the `--metrics-addr` flag to bind to a trusted network (e.g. `--metrics-addr=localhost:9090`) - Disable the metrics service via the flag (e.g. `--metrics-enabled=false`) - Adopt one of the recommended deployment models: [Authzed's managed services](https://authzed.com/pricing) or the [SpiceDB Operator](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb-operator) ### References - [GitHub Security Advisory issued for SpiceDB](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-cjr9-mr35-7xh6) - [Go issue #22085](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22085) for documenting the risks of exposing pprof to the internet - [Go issue #42834](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42834) discusses preventing pprof registration to the default serve mux - [semgrep rule go.lang.security.audit.net.pprof.pprof-debug-exposure](https://semgrep.dev/r?q=go.lang.security.audit.net.pprof) checks for a variation of this issue ### Credit We'd like to thank Amit Laish, a security researcher at GE Vernova for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-209""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:authzed:spicedb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.19.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""2A4C3AFF-BFA8-4CDD-8429-BAE623029B9B""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/9bbd7d76b6eaba33fe0236014f9b175d21232999"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.19.1"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-cjr9-mr35-7xh6"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/9bbd7d76b6eaba33fe0236014f9b175d21232999"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.19.1"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Release Notes"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-cjr9-mr35-7xh6"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"",""baseScore"":8.7,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""ADJACENT_NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.3,""impactScore"":5.8},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""NONE""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,,

Electron apps using `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected. This is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions. This issue is only exploitable if an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` can return an object or array that contains a javascript object which cannot be serialized, for instance, a canvas rendering context. This would normally result in an exception being thrown `Error: object could not be cloned`. The app side workaround is to ensure that such a case is not possible. Ensure all values returned from a function exposed over the context bridge are supported.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g., ""var a = {{.}}""), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template. Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21.

They maintain that their solution functions as a management layer over Windows settings and is not to blame for limitations in Windows' detection capabilities.","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-1333""}]},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-1333""}]}]","[{""operator"":""AND"",""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:heimdalsecurity:thor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""3.7.0"",""matchCriteriaId"":""81ED23F2-9637-4AB3-949C-7A7BE73A6BF9""}]},{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""A2572D17-1DE6-457B-99CC-64AFD54487EA""}]}]},{""operator"":""AND"",""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:heimdalsecurity:thor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndIncluding"":""2.6.9"",""matchCriteriaId"":""AF6E8BE4-9359-4FFE-AAF5-91CEF7EF892F""}]},{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":false,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:apple:macos:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""387021A0-AF36-463C-A605-32EA7DAC172E""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://medium.com/%40drabek.a/weaknesses-in-heimdal-thors-line-of-products-9d0e5095fb93"",""source"":""cve@mitre.org"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://medium.com/%40drabek.a/weaknesses-in-heimdal-thors-line-of-products-9d0e5095fb93"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9},{""source"":""134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.8,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,,

Any user who can create a space can become admin of that space through App Within Minutes. The admin right implies the script right and thus allows JavaScript injection. The vulnerability can be exploited by creating an app in App Within Minutes. If the button should be disabled because the user doesn't have global edit right, the app can also be created by directly opening `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/CreateApplication?wizard=true` on the XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.1 and 15.0 RC1 by not granting the space admin right if the user doesn't have script right on the space where the app is created. Error message are displayed to warn the user that the app will be broken in this case. Users who became space admin through this vulnerability won't loose the space admin right due to the fix, so it is advised to check if all users who created AWM apps should keep their space admin rights.

Users unable to upgrade may modify the page `XWiki.Notifications.Code.LegacyNotificationAdministration` to add the missing escaping. For versions < 14.6-rc-1 a workaround is to modify the file `<xwikiwebapp>/templates/distribution/eventmigration.wiki` to add the missing escaping.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-74""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""14.4.8"",""matchCriteriaId"":""18312249-9E74-4967-B376-EDD80C07233B""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""14.5"",""versionEndExcluding"":""14.10.3"",""matchCriteriaId"":""4472030C-B32C-42AD-B137-2FA730A29836""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/6d74e2e4aa03d19f0be385ab63ae9e0f0e90a766"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/8e7c7f90f2ddaf067cb5b83b181af41513028754#diff-4e13f4ee4a42938bf1201b7ee71ca32edeacba22559daf0bcb89d534e0225949R70"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-jgg7-w2rj-58cj"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Patch"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20287"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/6d74e2e4aa03d19f0be385ab63ae9e0f0e90a766"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/8e7c7f90f2ddaf067cb5b83b181af41513028754#diff-4e13f4ee4a42938bf1201b7ee71ca32edeacba22559daf0bcb89d534e0225949R70"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Patch""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-jgg7-w2rj-58cj"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Patch"",""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20287"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Exploit"",""Issue Tracking"",""Patch"",""Vendor Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":9.9,""baseSeverity"":""CRITICAL"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""CHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.1,""impactScore"":6.0},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"",""baseScore"":8.8,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""HIGH"",""integrityImpact"":""HIGH"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":5.9}]",,,,,,,,

As a workaround, validate HTTP header keys and/or values, and if using user-supplied values, filter them to strip off leading or trailing newline characters before calling `withHeader()`.","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Primary"",""description"":[{""lang"":""en"",""value"":""CWE-20""}]}]","[{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.18.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""BFBEAEC3-D107-4137-91F2-8A84490184E3""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:2.19.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DB1A0F96-4101-4B39-8978-56E99B4A9AC1""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:2.20.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""F9DE2176-DE48-4C54-8BD6-544963C6DF2A""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:2.21.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""A4C5DAF3-32CD-4E9B-A65D-182C539657D5""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:2.22.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""97159541-821D-4653-BEA4-C56A28F8C294""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:2.23.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""59692B7C-63C6-4461-9B88-A0654CD7F97C""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:2.24.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""7084070F-E50B-4E81-8DE4-A1775FAB4487""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:getlaminas:laminas-diactoros:2.25.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""3CBCC392-7E5C-4787-B4AF-E158F3E71DBD""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:psr-7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionEndExcluding"":""1.9.1"",""matchCriteriaId"":""704750B5-E610-4CDF-AE19-64DA9B537919""},{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:psr-7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""versionStartIncluding"":""2.0.0"",""versionEndExcluding"":""2.4.5"",""matchCriteriaId"":""DB62DA3C-0E8C-4240-9238-67D584A839D3""}]}]},{""nodes"":[{""operator"":""OR"",""negate"":false,""cpeMatch"":[{""vulnerable"":true,""criteria"":""cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"",""matchCriteriaId"":""CC559B26-5DFC-4B7A-A27C-B77DE755DFF9""}]}]}]","[{""url"":""https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxmh-65f7-jcvw"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Not Applicable""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros/security/advisories/GHSA-xv3h-4844-9h36"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPW54QK7ISDALPLP2CKODU4ZIVRYS336/"",""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxmh-65f7-jcvw"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Not Applicable""]},{""url"":""https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros/security/advisories/GHSA-xv3h-4844-9h36"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Vendor Advisory""]},{""url"":""https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPW54QK7ISDALPLP2CKODU4ZIVRYS336/"",""source"":""af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"",""tags"":[""Mailing List"",""Third Party Advisory""]}]","[{""source"":""security-advisories@github.com"",""type"":""Secondary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":7.5,""baseSeverity"":""HIGH"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""NONE"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":3.9,""impactScore"":3.6},{""source"":""nvd@nist.gov"",""type"":""Primary"",""cvssData"":{""version"":""3.1"",""vectorString"":""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"",""baseScore"":6.5,""baseSeverity"":""MEDIUM"",""attackVector"":""NETWORK"",""attackComplexity"":""LOW"",""privilegesRequired"":""LOW"",""userInteraction"":""NONE"",""scope"":""UNCHANGED"",""confidentialityImpact"":""NONE"",""integrityImpact"":""NONE"",""availabilityImpact"":""HIGH""},""exploitabilityScore"":2.8,""impactScore"":3.6}]",,,,,,,,
